Electricity and magnetism are  the ultimate power duo—each one impressive on its own, but truly extraordinary together. Their “relationship” forms the backbone of modern technology, sparking inventions from electric motors to smartphones. To really appreciate how electric and magnetic fields team up, let’s dive into their unique personalities and see what makes their connection so electrifying. Electric Fields: Origin of Power Electric fields arise from charged particles like protons (positive) and electrons (negative), each generating an “invisible field” that exerts forces on other charges, either attracting or repelling them. While electric fields may seem abstract, they permeate our daily experiences— the small shock felt when touching a doorknob after walking across a carpet is the result of static electricity—an electric field that builds up due to accumulated charges on the skin. Lightning, a striking natural display, demonstrates the same principle on a massive scale, where the electric field is intense enough to discharge dramatically. A unique aspect of electric fields is their connection to magnetism: a stationary charge produces only an electric field, but as it begins to move, a magnetic field emerges, encircling its path in loops perpendicular to the direction of motion. This phenomenon can be visualized through the “right-hand rule”—if one curls their fingers in the direction of the current, the thumb will point along the magnetic field lines. This intrinsic link between electric and magnetic forces exemplifies the underlying unity of electromagnetism, revealing how each field enhances and shapes the other. The Magnetic Field: The Dynamic Partner Magnetic fields differ fundamentally from electric fields because they do not originate from static charges but form around moving electric charges, such as electrons orbiting within atoms or currents flowing through conductors. Unlike electric charges, which can exist independently as positive or negative, magnetic poles are inseparable: they always manifest as north-south pairs. If a magnet is divided, each fragment becomes a smaller magnet with its own north and south poles, reflecting the inherent duality of magnetic fields. Magnetic fields exert distinctive forces of attraction and repulsion. Anyone who has felt two magnets snap together or resist each other has encountered this invisible force directly. Crucially, a magnetic field cannot exist independently of a moving electric charge, underscoring the interdependent relationship between electricity and magnetism. The connection between electric and magnetic fields becomes particularly significant with electromagnetic induction. When a magnetic field changes—whether through motion or fluctuation—it induces an electric field around it, a process fundamental to the operation of generators. In generators, coils of wire rotate through a magnetic field, and the changing magnetic flux induces an electric current in the coils. This phenomenon reveals that changing magnetic fields can give rise to electric fields, illustrating the profound link between electricity and magnetism through the dynamics of movement. Maxwell: The Matchmaker of Electric and Magnetic Fields In the 19th century, physicist James Clerk Maxwell became the “matchmaker” when he developed an equation that showed how a changing electric field creates a magnetic field, and vice versa, and he later on even predicted that light itself is an electromagnetic wave where electric and magnetic fields oscillate in perfect harmony. 
 Maxwell revealed that electricity and magnetism are, in a sense, two sides of the same coin—inseparable by nature. Thanks to his work, we now know that electric and magnetic fields don’t just coexist but actually generate each other, creating a partnership that powers our world. Electromagnetic Waves: The Love Child of Electric and Magnetic Fields When electric and magnetic fields interact, they give rise to something extraordinary: electromagnetic waves. The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses everything from radio waves that transmit music and Wi-Fi signals to visible light and even X-rays. These waves are uniquely self-sustaining—a changing electric field generates a magnetic field, which in turn induces a new electric field, creating a continuous cycle that propels the wave forward. The Ultimate Romantic Relationship Electric and magnetic fields don’t just power each other—they empower each other, creating a feedback loop that keeps energy flowing in devices, in our lives, and in the world around us. Their partnership reminds us that in physics, connections matter, and the most powerful results come from forces working together in everlasting harmony.

This article shines a light on the often-overlooked astrocyte, revealing its critical functions in neuronal communication, protection, and metabolic support. Introduction Since publishing An Ode to Microglia  seven months ago, I have been consumed by a sense of guilt—one that I finally wish to unload. Today, I come forth with a confession to you all: I am nominating a different cell for the glial throne. In all fairness, when I wrote An Ode to Microglia, I never claimed that it was the best, but argued it is unfairly shadowed by the awesomeness of its peer, the neuron. I now realize, however, that in awarding the microglia the attention it deserves, I unjustly dismissed another hero. But alas, I return to correct my misdeed. I present to you, An Ode to the Astrocyte. Fluorescent astrocytes with glowing green processes and blue nuclei. Rediscovering the Brain's ""Glue"": The Evolving Understanding of Glial Cells For years, scientists significantly underestimated the role of glial cells in the brain. The term neuroglia itself was coined by German pathologist Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow in 1858 when, observing strange masses surrounding neurons, he figured they were connective tissue—the “glue”—of the brain. We now know that glial cells are a world of their own, but if one of them truly “holds it together,” you could make a solid case for the astrocyte. One of the key ideas preached in every cell biology class is that structure defines function. Named with the Greek prefix “astro-” due to its stellated shape, the astrocyte not only looks like a star, it is one. The Tripartite Synapse and Astrocyte's Role in Neuronal Communication Over the past two decades, neurobiologists have expanded their understanding of the synapse—the space between two communicating neurons where one releases ions onto the next, in order to propagate an electrical signal. A new notion, coined the “tripartite synapse,” conveys a fuller picture of neuronal communication that occurs in many regions of the brain, composed of three partners: two neurons and an astrocyte. Just as a chef developing a new recipe will taste and make adjustments before delivering it to customers, the astrocyte adjusts the chemical environment between neurons and even releases some of its own, to ensure that the transmitted signal is perfect. Scientists have discovered that astrocytes express receptors for certain signal molecules, called neurotransmitters. When neurotransmitters bind, they trigger intracellular changes to Ca2+ concentrations in the astrocytes, which may prompt them to release their own neurotransmitters as well to strengthen, weaken, or fine-tune the neuronal signal. Neurotransmitter release at a synaptic cleft, with an astrocyte process taking up spillover molecules In addition to releasing signals of its own, the astrocyte can also uptake neurotransmitters from the synapse to both prevent toxic signaling and convert them to different molecular forms that can be reused by neurons. Glutamate, the brain’s primary excitatory neurotransmitter, is known to cause an event called excitotoxicity when released in surplus. As the name suggests, excitotoxicity is deadly to neurons and is associated with a multitude of disorders ranging from ALS, Huntington’s Disease, and Multiple Sclerosis, to Epilepsy, Schizophrenia, and Autism., Astrocytes play a crucial role in modulating glutamate signaling by taking up any excess, converting it to its precursor form, and transporting it back to the neurons to reuse when needed. Astrocytes: Guardians of the Brain and Metabolic Powerhouses Excitotoxicity is not the only danger that the astrocyte protects us from. Beyond their roles at the neuronal synapse, astrocytes also associate with the capillaries of the brain. By wrapping their fine, limb-like extensions around endothelial cells and secreting special molecules, they promote their adhesion to reinforce the semi-permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Due to the inability of neurons to regenerate, this function is crucial for preventing the entry of harmful chemicals that may cause neuronal injury. When we go to sleep, astrocytes use their aquaporin channels to circulate fluid in the brain, helping to flush out any toxins or waste that may have accumulated. As if that wasn’t enough, astrocytes use their close contact with blood vessels to absorb glucose, convert it to lactate, and shuttle it to neurons. During periods of high brain activity, such as memory formation, this becomes especially beneficial. Instead of performing ten metabolic reactions to convert glucose to pyruvate,  lactate only requires one. Concluding Remarks: A Call for Recognition  For too long, the narrative of the brain has been neuron-centric, like imagining a galaxy with only one type of planet. The more we learn about the complex relationships that constitute our brains, the clearer it becomes that no single cell acts in isolation. Yet, if there is one cell that truly holds it all together—the tireless soldier that holds up the forts of the nervous system while nourishing its neighboring neurons and providing metabolic support—it is the “star”-cell. My previous ode celebrated the important contributions of the microglia, and rightly so. But in rectifying that oversight, I hope to have shone a deserving spotlight on the astrocyte, whose functions are, quite literally, central to our ability to think, feel, and function. The story of the astrocyte is far from fully written, inviting a new generation of scientists to continue uncovering its secrets and revolutionizing our understanding of the brain.",0,"en",2025-07-27T00:43:20Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""iz2zc515"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""While neurons often take center stage in discussions about the brain, other cells play equally vital roles.

Delving into genetics reveals that tiny regulatory tweaks in gene expression can trigger massive shifts, influencing everything from camouflage and mimicry to courtship behaviors. By understanding these molecular mechanisms, scientists unravel not only how insects communicate visually but also how evolution endlessly crafts complexity and diversity from genetic simplicity. Heliconius Melpomene, the Postman Butterfly - a likely hybrid  between melpomene subspecies malleti  and plesseni ( by Miroslav Srb, licensed for educational use via Adobe Stock). The most captivating aspect of insects, looking past their naturally uncharismatic morphologies, is the diversity of pigmentation and patterning they can display; this field of study within insect biology spans over a breadth of sub-disciplines, including development, biochemistry, biophysics, genetics, evolution, and ecology. Its significance as an evolutionary trait is undeniable, playing roles in intra- and interspecific communication patterns, mimicry and camouflage, as well as physiological and biochemical processes [1]. While the functional importance behind the evolution of coloration is well characterized, what we often don’t understand is the basis of coloration on a molecular level. Insects, as a class, boast an astounding diversity of color patterns, ranging from 300 to 700 nm wavelengths—reaching outside the spectrum of visible light for mammals [2]. Modern research has only scratched the surface in uncovering the genes responsible for generating this variability between insect species; beginning to understand the developmental role that a gene may play tells us only a fraction of the picture, as these functions are not set in evolutionary “stone.” For example, yellow, a gene known to produce melanin pigment, is ubiquitously expressed throughout the wings and wing veins of fruit flies to produce patterns necessary for communication [3]. While various homologues—genes inherited from common ancestry—of yellow are known to code for similar functions, slight tuning of its spatial and temporal expression can give rise to not only an incredible number of novel phenotypes and patterns but completely new functions as well. How a particular protein or RNA interacts with its surrounding cellular environment is of utmost importance in determining its function [4]. To put this into perspective, yellow can take on an additional role, as it is necessary for male courtship behavior in several fruit fly species. Behavioral assays have determined that the presence of these melanic wing spots is an agent of sexual selection—tying yellow to not only producing secondary sexual characteristics from a morphological standpoint but doubling down on sexual selection through mediating physiological and neuronal processes, ultimately affecting behavior to increase direct fitness [5]. Interestingly, this goes both ways; the yellow orthologue (the same yellow gene passed down from common ancestry, granted with some small changes between species) in Bicyclus butterflies acts to repress male courtship behavior, displaying the volatility of small evolutionary tuning of gene expression. Here we see selection acting two ways on a single gene; it’s not uncommon that we find genes responsible for producing a visual signal also encode either positive or negative behavioral preference for such signals [6]. Visual signals are essential for communication, and with an expanded toolkit of diverse chemical pigments, insects are the most interesting system to study these visual signals. Despite the wide range of possibilities, nature finds ways to reuse especially useful patterns and colors for certain signals or signaling systems. To give an example, we can look to the evolution of mimicry, a strategy used often by various insect species. Mimicry describes how those of different species begin to evolve similar, or ‘mimicked,’ phenotypes as a way to amplify a signal—as some are especially valuable to many insect species. Aposematic coloration, a warning signal to predators to alert them of toxicity (or just of bad taste), holds much value as a phenotype to mimic. Many species take up similar signals like these, not because they think it's pretty, but because an evolutionary force selecting for these traits pushes species towards congruence with these patterns and colors—all driven by maximizing fitness, the success rate at which genes are passed onto the next generation.   Limenitis archippus  (Viceroy, Left) Danaus   plexippus  (Monarch, Right) What has been more elusive to our understanding, however, isn’t why these phenomena evolve—but how. Recent research suggests that certain natural instances of pattern mimicry can be explained by a single master regulator gene; optix, a homeobox (a family of proteins, all of which include a characteristic ‘homeobox’ domain) transcription factor, is responsible for the phenotypic expression of red patterning in Heliconius butterflies [7]. What makes this case stand out is the repeated evolution of optix in multiple different species to give rise to a seemingly infinite number of patterns and variations. Heliconius erato   amazonia  (Red Postman, Left) and Heliconius melpomene melpomene  (Postman, Right) This isn’t as simple as directly mutating the gene sequence repeatedly—no, that’s much too random and deleterious to consistently act as a driving force for evolution. The most common form of molecular and developmental change in evolution comes from regulatory tweaks. Similar to yellow, nature can twist parameters on where, when, and how these genes are expressed, all through changes in cis-regulatory expression. Cis-regulatory elements include enhancer and repressor regions in DNA—where important transcription factors bind in order to activate or hinder gene expression (the process of turning DNA sequences into RNA, and ultimately [but not always] protein). As mentioned, these cis-regulatory elements truly control every advanced direction for a gene during development [8]. Variations in DNA sequence, transcription factor or cofactor accessibility, and epigenetic modifications are all examples of factors that influence enhancer or repressor activity. These changes, in turn, regulate the expression of genes like optix, determining its activation in specific scale types or regions of the butterfly wing. Similar to yellow, evolution has a way of shifting not just parameters, but function, as a result. While the optix gene sequence remains the same in other butterfly & moth species, it has been shown to be absent in the production of red pigment. Understanding the mechanisms behind the gain and loss of regulatory specifications is a compelling way to study evolution, and researchers are only beginning to pull back the film in this field.

The most common form of molecular and developmental change in evolution comes from regulatory tweaks. Similar to yellow, nature can twist parameters on where, when, and how these genes are expressed, all through changes in cis-regulatory expression. Cis-regulatory elements include enhancer and repressor regions in DNA—where important transcription factors bind in order to activate or hinder gene expression (the process of turning DNA sequences into RNA, and ultimately [but not always] protein). As mentioned, these cis-regulatory elements truly control every advanced direction for a gene during development [8]. Variations in DNA sequence, transcription factor or cofactor accessibility, and epigenetic modifications are all examples of factors that influence enhancer or repressor activity. These changes, in turn, regulate the expression of genes like optix, determining its activation in specific scale types or regions of the butterfly wing. Similar to yellow, evolution has a way of shifting not just parameters, but function, as a result. While the optix gene sequence remains the same in other butterfly & moth species, it has been shown to be absent in the production of red pigment. Understanding the mechanisms behind the gain and loss of regulatory specifications is a compelling way to study evolution, and researchers are only beginning to pull back the film in this field."",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}}],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""LEFT""}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""rmzqh6398"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""LEFT""}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""idr0z6427"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""LEFT""}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""0jjts6456"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Sources:"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700},{""type"":""FONT_SIZE"",""fontSizeData"":{""unit"":""PX"",""value"":14}}]}}],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""LEFT""}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""t68h16834"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""[1] "",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700},{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}},{""type"":""FONT_SIZE"",""fontSizeData"":{""unit"":""PX"",""value"":14}}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""O’Hanlon, et al.

One person’s findings become the foundation of another person’s next decade of work, and if that foundation is revealed to be faulty, you’re out of luck. You can’t wing a research experiment. You can’t just be ‘pretty sure’ you added an aliquot from vial A and not accidentally from vial B. You can’t just synthesize a drug that you think might work , or calculate the amount of fuel necessary to send a spaceship to Mars and cross your fingers that it will be enough. Precision matters and the work is serious.  With that being said, STEM students and professionals deserve to let loose sometimes and have fun where we can. As a devout believer in the religion of Silly, I have immense appreciation for my predecessors in science who have chosen to permeate the studies of life with the wackiest of words, and I hope to share the joy that some of these words have given me with the rest of the science community. In this aim, I contacted some Georgetown University professors to inquire about their favorite wacky words, and I bring them to you here today. I hope we can all find ways to spontaneously incorporate these words into our daily lexicon; to brighten the lives of others and bask in the joy of scientific nomenclature.

 Perhaps it is no coincidence that some of science’s wackiest words involve the study of the ear; the researchers of the auditory system have ensured that their studies be audibly exciting. Dr. Thomas Coate, an Associate Professor and Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies at Georgetown University’s Department of Biology, also happens to study what I’ve recently discovered to be a wacky-word treasure trove — the cochlea. This spiral-shaped, fluid-filled structure in the inner ear is unsurprisingly complicated and intricate. The cochlea is not only fascinating to study for its elaborate anatomical structure or crucial function in mediating human communication, but also for the neverending linguistic excitement it offers.  Upon performing a quick search for ‘labeled cochlea’ you might find yourself pleasantly surprised, as I was, to learn of the ‘scala vestibuli,’ ‘tectorial membrane,’ or ‘spiral ganglion.’ One structure that artists often neglect from these diagrams, though, which perhaps only a cochlea expert like Dr. Coate himself would be acquainted with, is the ‘habenula perforata.’ In the grand scheme of the ear, these small perforations may appear insignificant, but their importance should not be underestimated.  To reference the long-standing question Dr. Coate asked in my introductory Neurobiology course, “if a tree falls in an empty forest, does it make a sound?” In short, the answer is both yes and no. Sound, in its essence, is the periodic vibration of air molecules within a specific frequency range perceptible to the human brain. As such, sound waves can exist outside of human perception as vibrations of air, but the act of ‘hearing’ these oscillations requires a brain to process them. Returning to the habenula perforata, these perforations within the bony structure of the cochlea provide an opening for auditory nerve fibers to pass into the inner ear and innervate the hair cells that detect sound. If not for this seamless connection between our detection of sound as a physical sensation and the subsequent neural processing performed by our brain, we could not actually hear.

Epiboly Students who have taken an introductory biology course may recognize some of the embryonic development stages, namely morula, blastula, gastrulation, and neurulation, but these fun terms, it turns out, are just the beginning. Dr. Elena Silva, a professor in the Department of Biology at Georgetown University, studies neurodevelopment in the frog Xenopus laevis  and the acorn worm Saccoglossus kowalevski  (yes, full names included on purpose ;)). One of her favorite words in development, epiboly  (pronounced epíbolee), describes the process of cell division, flattening, and expansion that occurs during the embryonic stage of gastrulation in order to enclose the embryo with a layer of cells called surface ectoderm. The surface ectoderm eventually gives rise to epidermis (the outer layer of skin), hair and nails, inner ear structures (perhaps including the habenula perforata?) and more. Epiboly is a highly important process that enables humans to develop the right structures in the right places at the right time.

Tribbles Although many terms receive their wackiness from the way they sound, a few scientists have actively sought to imbue their work with fun concepts from outside the science world. You may have heard about Sonic Hedgehog — the signaling molecule involved in the development of the central nervous system — but have you heard about Tribbles? To quote Professor Mun Chun Chan of Georgetown University’s Department of Biology, these creatures, which originate from the original Star Trek series, “are cute balls of fur that squeak, and everyone loves them… except Klingons.” Although Tribbles only used to only belong to the world of Science Fiction, when researchers Jörg Großhans and Eric Wieschaus discovered that a genetic mutation caused fly larvae to develop into furballs in May, 2000, they aptly named the corresponding protein after the Star Trek species. For further amusement, later papers studying this protein continued to reference its Star Trek origins, with several papers titled after the episode in which they first appeared: “The Trouble with Tribbles” (Season 2, Episode 15 if you’re interested). Norbornane Although the previous three words were gracious contributions from my professors, I couldn’t end without paying my respects to a personal favorite of mine. In addition to admiring some biology-related words, I wanted to shed light on the wackiness that exists in what many find to be a highly intimidating field— organic chemistry.  In my organic chemistry course, one word struck me particularly. It struck my exam performance as well, which, to tell you the truth, is how I first encountered the molecule ‘norbornane.’ If you’re familiar with the Phineas and Ferb meme in which Doofenshmirtz says “if I had a nickel for every time [insert event] I’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice,” you’ll understand my sentiment when after exam two, I was again  deducted points for a problem pertaining to a seven-carbon bicyclic structure. Determined to never again let this carbon species defeat me, I went on a Google hunt for ‘hexene ring bridged bicyclic structure triangle,’ and was so delighted to discover the name of my nemesis— norbornane— that I named my plant after it. When my plant later died (unintentionally, of course), I grieved, but also took it as a sign that I had finally conquered my foe. Norbornane is used in various synthetic processes, and to those who have not yet taken organic chemistry, it is also commonly used by professors to trick students on stereochemistry-related problems. So beware! "" File:Norbornane-2D-skeletal.svg "" by WhiteTimberwolf, Ben Mills (PNG version)  is marked with CC0 1.0. Example Ways to Incorporate These Words Into Your Daily Language: These words may seem niche and irrelevant to your daily life, but I urge you to consider a different perspective. Oftentimes in my science lectures, the contrast between minute two, in which the professor is introducing the ‘key points’ of the day's lecture, and minute 38, in which we are knee-deep into a reaction pathway or biological process and I have completely lost track, can be extremely discouraging. It is in those moments, though, after moving past the surface-level material and truly entering the intricacies of life’s mechanisms, that we can really see its beauties, both metaphorically and literally. The four words I’ve highlighted may not be part of your everyday language, but they represent individual concepts that took years of research and inquiry to discover, and if you are open to learning about them, they’re right at your fingertips.  Besides my love for learning wacky words, I truly enjoy finding creative ways to incorporate them into my daily language. The following are some hypothetical situations that I have contrived to help demonstrate how you can do the same. “Are you even listening to me? It’s like words are going in one ear and coming out the other. Do you lack a   habenula perforata ?” “I was so confused by today’s lecture! The professor was speaking but that information definitely did not reach my   habenula perforata  because I have no idea what she said.” “Wow, I have so much work to do— I’m so all over the place I feel like I’m undergoing epiboly !” “I’m so excited to finish college, pursue my career, and reach my fate! I’m like a developing embryonic cell — I’m undergoing epiboly , and I’m just about to reach my destination and discover my potential!” “It’s so cold outside! Someone CRISPR a Tribbles  mutation into me  because I would really like to become a ball of fur!” For Norbornane , I don’t have any great examples, but I can confidently say from experience that it makes an excellent plant name. I could see it being used for a fish, as well.",0,"en",2025-03-23T14:39:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""09lfe12981"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Most people would agree that science is a serious field, as studying the inner workings of the physical and natural world demands precision and relentless inquiry.

Either you know an enzymatic pathway, mechanism, or the solution to a chemistry or physics problem– or you don’t. And from information about ecosystem to organism to organ to cell to electron to atom, when it comes to STEM, the nitty gritty can always get nittier, and then grittier. As students of the sciences, we take upon ourselves an ambitious goal to simultaneously learn all that is known, while learning how to learn the unknowns. Learning will never become easy, it is effortful and uncomfortable by nature. However, as students of the sciences, we have the advantage of empirical knowledge of the body and of the mind. By truly understanding certain mental processes, we can leverage this knowledge to, at the least, ensure that our learning is as efficient and mindful as possible.  The process of learning and memorization is still largely a mystery, but is known to involve changes to neuronal connections that are beyond our conscious control. However, the process of learning involves many components, some of which we have the capacity to influence. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter used by the brain, plays an important role in our motivation to do difficult tasks; while the tasks themselves don’t become easier, dopamine increases our drive to perform them. As such, understanding the mechanisms by which dopamine facilitates drive and motivation can help us fuel our ambitious goals, and prime us for increased achievement.  The Central Nervous System: Context About the Brain  
 For those who are less familiar with the brain, neurons— the primary cell of the central nervous system— form a complex communication system that enables us to think, experience, perform and exist as conscious beings. Unlike most cells of the body, which communicate by chemical signals, neurons mediate fast signal transmission through electrical currents produced by ion flow. This can sometimes involve direct ion transmission between neurons (at gap junctions), but neurons most often communicate by releasing molecules, known as neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters can act as agonists for ion channels– allowing the movement of ions in/out of the cell to create an electrical current– or they may bind to G-protein coupled receptors, which either cause cellular changes through second messengers, or open ion channels. You may have heard of some of these neurotransmitters (ex. glutamate, GABA, serotonin), but today’s discussion centers on dopamine.  Dopamine in the Brain Dopamine serves several functions in the brain (such as movement and emotion), but some of its key functions include learning, attention, and reward. You can think of dopamine as an ‘I want more,’ ‘feel-good’ signal. Unlike, for example, a content and peaceful, looking-out-into-the-sunset happiness, in which you feel at peace, dopamine is a good feeling that drives you to keep going. Think chocolate: one bite is great, but you always want another. Behaviors that involve a drive associated with reward, such as pleasurable foods and sex, involve dopamine; so does, for example, drug addiction– dopamine is a powerful chemical. The relevance of dopamine to your studying has exactly to do with this: studying is difficult to do, but on the molecular level, it is not a foreign process to your brain. Everything you know now, you once did not. The difficulty with studying and learning often lies with initiation and with the personal motivation to just do it. The beautiful thing, though, is that you reap the benefits of this labor: at the end, there comes a good grade, or, more importantly, an intrinsic feeling of success and accomplishment. Of reward. The culprit? Dopamine. We talk frequently of discipline and work ethic, but the mind, like the rest of us, functions by means of physical, tangible processes. Though ‘discipline’ is a nice concept, it should be noted that there are real, physical mechanisms that allow us to ‘do,’ and to want to do, and the release of dopamine is crucial to these mechanisms. Dopamine: Limitations & Implications So let’s get nittier. Chemicals don’t appear out of thin air; dopamine is produced from precursors in the cell, and stored in vesicles at the bottom of the neuron, ready to be released. When signaling initiates an ion current, the contents of the vesicles are released from the neuron, releasing dopamine to other neurons. It is important to understand that this process involves first synthesis, and then release, because the availability of dopamine, to drive us to perform activities, is dependent on these processes. There is no infinite supply, and availability is not a continuous and stable ‘given’. If you deplete your dopamine stock through mindless stimulation, you will decrease your drive to perform subsequent behaviors. When you perform a rewarding behavior, such as scrolling on social media mindlessly, it is truly difficult to stop. If I lie down on a sofa and then want to get up, I have no problem doing so. But for some reason, when it's 11:57pm and I know I need to get to sleep already, but have to get up to brush my teeth first, it’s nearly impossible. The bursts of dopamine prompted by my explore page– perfectly curated to pique my interests– have deprived me of the drive to do other things. This is one of the reasons why everyone and their mother tell you not to get on your phone first thing in the morning; it doesn’t just ‘set the tone,’ it robs you of drive. Contextualizing Dopamine in Your Life  While we all like to feel good, it could be helpful to think of dopamine like cash, and your brain as the wallet. In theory, you could spend your money on anything you’d like; you could enter a mall and buy everything until you’re out. But to get more money, you need to do work– and some things provide more instant gratification, but take away from your ability to make better, more rewarding purchases in the future. Next time you have an urge to scroll on your phone, think of it like m&ms; they’re great and all, but would you waste your money and pay for them if it comes out of your retirement fund, or even just your savings for a trip? To continue with the analogy of money, cash is earned through work: dopamine is too. As you perform the difficult task of learning, memorizing, and thinking, your brain synthesizes more dopamine. More effort materializes in stronger feelings of reward. Additionally important is to not only anticipate some struggle, but also to aim for it– or at least accept it. When we constantly increase our baseline dopamine levels, the experience of reward will begin to diminish, and we need more and more stimulation to experience these feelings. This is part of the underlying physical components of drug addiction. Though this may sound discouraging to consider, it should serve as a welcome reminder that you can actually look forward to the difficult feelings of effort with the knowledge that they will actually result in more reward. But also, this should caution you away from piling on quick and easy sources of dopamine (ex. always listening to music on runs, rewarding yourself for schoolwork/performance with unhealthy foods, drinking energy drinks every time you need more focus). Every now and then, we all need to do what we need to do, but be cognizant and mindful that you aren’t relying on them constantly; over time, if everything is always easy and enjoyable, we don’t just notice that other things aren’t as enjoyable, but they actually become less enjoyable.  What is the Main Takeaway? There is much more to say about dopamine, and I will leave some great and approachable resources below. To summarize, though, there is no molecule that makes anything easy, and as students with the job to learn, our task will never not be effortful. However, our drive, which pushes us to perform the work we are required to do, has a chemical basis: dopamine. Like everything in life, dopamine is a finite resource, limited by the presence of its precursors and the time of its synthesis. Through quick, mindless, and high dopamine release, you reduce your neurons’ supply, and consequently your drive to perform ambitious tasks, such as studying. Additionally, increasing your baseline levels of dopamine through continuous use of quick sources, will increase your threshold levels necessary to facilitate drive. To leverage this information to enhance your ability to perform rigorous tasks like studying, avoid dopamine-depleting activities like social media and intensely satisfying foods/treats, especially before work, and prevent increased baseline levels through consistent layering or reliance on dopamine sources. I know this information isn’t ‘fun,’ and ‘easy,’ but hopefully a look into the biological mechanisms involved in effort can help you better consider decisions, or at least become more mindful of their stakes and implications.  Resources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmOF0crdyRU&t=2218s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6BoSORXCUg https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/tools-to-manage-dopamine-and-improve-motivation-and-drive",0,"en",2024-12-23T22:39:49Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""HEADING"",""id"":""l3pby146"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""\n"",""decorations"":[]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Calling All STEM Students— Why You Should Rethink Your Methods"",""decorations"":[]}}],""headingData"":{""level"":3}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""e4q7t150"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""ltk50151"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""STEM curriculums are no joke; there is no room for error or opinion, only facts and uncertainties.

Every now and then, we all need to do what we need to do, but be cognizant and mindful that you aren’t relying on them constantly; over time, if everything is always easy and enjoyable, we don’t just notice that other things aren’t as enjoyable, but they actually become less enjoyable. "",""decorations"":[]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""type"":""DIVIDER"",""id"":""g6xcw2364"",""nodes"":[],""dividerData"":{""containerData"":{""textWrap"":false,""height"":{},""spoiler"":{},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""width"":{}},""lineStyle"":""SINGLE"",""width"":""LARGE"",""alignment"":""CENTER""}},{""type"":""HEADING"",""id"":""5k3n82366"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""What is the Main Takeaway?"",""decorations"":[]}}],""headingData"":{""level"":4}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""tut1x2521"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""1xyxj2522"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""There is much more to say about dopamine, and I will leave some great and approachable resources below. To summarize, though, there is no molecule that makes anything easy, and as students with the job to learn, our task will never not be effortful. However, our drive, which pushes us to perform the work we are required to do, has a chemical basis: dopamine. Like everything in life, dopamine is a finite resource, limited by the presence of its precursors and the time of its synthesis. Through quick, mindless, and high dopamine release, you reduce your neurons’ supply, and consequently your drive to perform ambitious tasks, such as studying. Additionally, increasing your baseline levels of dopamine through continuous use of quick sources, will increase your threshold levels necessary to facilitate drive. To leverage this information to enhance your ability to perform rigorous tasks like studying, avoid dopamine-depleting activities like social media and intensely satisfying foods/treats, especially before work, and prevent increased baseline levels through consistent layering or reliance on dopamine sources. I know this information isn’t ‘fun,’ and ‘easy,’ but hopefully a look into the biological mechanisms involved in effort can help you better consider decisions, or at least become more mindful of their stakes and implications. "",""decorations"":[]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""pi33h76"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""HTML"",""id"":""yxkh275"",""nodes"":[],""htmlData"":{""containerData"":{""textWrap"":true,""height"":{""custom"":""550""},""spoiler"":{},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""width"":{""custom"":""350""}},""html"":""<script

In science, paradoxes aren’t tripwires to be avoided but navigational beacons that guide us toward more accurate frameworks. Where Logic Bends In its most distilled form, science relies on models: systems built to quantify, predict, and explain. These models are optimized, peer-reviewed, and rigorously tested — often between jet-lagged shots of espresso and keynote slides. Yet, every so often, when a model stumbles over its own blindspot such as an untested assumption or an ignored variable; a contradiction emerges. Scientific paradoxes spotlight the limitations of our current conceptual frameworks, revealing the assumptions that have been mistaken for certainty. What initially appears to be the collapse of our models challenges us to rethink their foundations and redefine the premises they rest upon.  Penrose Cube: A mind-bending illusion that twists geometry and perspective. By fran_kie. Here are three paradoxes, quiet but unrelenting, that challenge models across the scientific disciplines – from molecular biology and immunology to neuroscience. These occurrences aren't anomalies. Instead, they’re recurring challenges in laboratories, simulations, and decision-making processes, reminding us that science is an ever-evolving process of refinement.   Premonition in the Pancreas: Biology Plays the Long Game In the pancreas, alpha and beta cells regulate blood glucose through a negative feedback loop: beta cells release insulin to lower glucose levels and alpha cells release the hormone glucagon to raise it. They are biochemical opposites and yet their behavior defies the simplicity of the existing model. Beta cells begin suppressing alpha cells through local paracrine signals—such as insulin and zinc— before  glucose levels rise significantly. Alpha cells, likewise, prepare glucagon release ahead of hypoglycemia. These cells are not merely reacting to change; they are anticipating it. This is anticipatory regulation — feedback driven by inferred trends rather than real-time inputs.  Mechanistically, this anticipation is driven by tight intercellular signaling, electrical coupling, and somatostatin released from delta cells. But at the systems level, it challenges the basic assumptions of control theory, which holds that feedback loops operate in a strict temporal order: stimulus, response, correction. This kind of predictive behavior is echoed across biological processes. Neurons fire in anticipation of sensory stimuli. Immune systems prime against pathogens not yet encountered. Even artificial systems, like machine learning models, begin detecting patterns before they fully emerge. Cells don’t think, but evolution has tuned their networks to behave as though they do, encoding environmental regularities into structure. Schrödinger’s Lab: No Such Thing as a Truly Isolated System You’ve controlled variables. Sterilized everything. The setup is clean. And still, something unexpected occurs: a cell misbehaves, a material reacts, a measurement drifts. The anomaly isn’t in the result, it is in the assumption that the system was ever neutral to begin with. In synthetic biology — the field of engineering and redesigning organisms — cells act unpredictably even under tightly controlled settings. In physics, inert materials catalyze reactions. In behavioral science, genetically identical animals show divergent behavior despite identical environments. Sometimes, the context isn’t the background noise, but part of the signal we intend to measure. Enter Schrödinger’s cat, an iconic thought experiment in quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger imagined a cat placed inside a sealed box, along with a radioactive atom, a Geiger counter to detect ionizing radiation, and a vial of poison. If, in some random quantum event, the atom decays, it triggers the Geiger counter, releasing the poison and thus killing the cat. If it doesn’t decay, the cat lives. According to one interpretation of quantum theory, until the box is opened and the system is measured, the atom exists in a superposition of both decayed and not decayed — and thus, the cat is both dead and alive at the same time. Illustration of Schrödinger’s Cat Thought Experiment. By Oleksander Hokusai Schrödinger didn’t propose this to suggest cats live in quantum limbo. Instead, he was highlighting how absurd quantum principles become when scaled up to everyday objects. Regardless, the core insight of the thought experiment remains: in quantum systems, observation isn’t passive and measuring a system doesn’t simply uncover its state — it helps determine it. At the quantum level, this concept is formalized — measurement collapses a probabilistic system into a definite outcome — but the philosophical implications don’t stop there. In experimental science more broadly, the assumption that we can observe a system without affecting it is often more of an aspiration than reality. I’m not claiming that your experimental cells will flourish if you sing to them but labs are never truly neutral. Instruments carry biases, and observation itself shapes outcomes. In fields beyond quantum mechanics, scientists are forced to confront the fact that observation is part of the experiment. When the Output is Right but the Wiring is a Mystery A machine-learning model trained on noisy, incomplete data predicts outcomes surprisingly accurately. A climate model, even if missing key variables, still produces projections that align with observed outcomes. In genomics, partial sequence data yield reliable predictions of complex traits. The outputs are right. The mechanisms remain unclear. This is the paradox of overperforming systems: tools that produce valid results despite operating beyond the limits of our understanding. Statistically, this might suggest overfitting, when a model memorizes quirks in the training data and performs well there but fails to generalize. Yet many of these systems, especially in machine learning, do generalize. Deep learning models, for instance, often detect structure and patterns beyond human intuition. In biology, complex traits emerge from vast networks of genes and regulatory factors that defy simple causality, and yet, predictive models sometimes work anyways. The Black Box: Where data goes in, but mystery comes out. By Tameem The challenge is epistemological as much as it is technical. In high-stakes fields like medicine, where the use of artificial intelligence for medical diagnoses is rapidly emerging — understanding how a model arrives at its output matters just as much as the output itself. When a system yields results that cannot be explained, it becomes a black box whose inner workings are hidden or poorly understood. And, when prediction outpaces explanation, we risk mistaking the model for the world it was meant to describe. Why Paradox Matters Paradoxes are not signs that science is broken. Rather, they mark the places where our models no longer account for what we observe. They arise when data outpaces interpretation, and systems behave in ways our theories weren’t built to capture. At the intersection of science and policy — in labs, institutions, and data-driven decisions — paradoxes do not serve as errors to fix or noise to filter out. They are invitations: prompts to re-examine assumptions, refine frameworks, and ask better questions. So, when data misbehaves, models perform too well, or variables refuse to remain independent, don’t rush to declare failure. It may not be the system that’s broken. It may be your thinking that’s due for revision. References:  Rorsman, P., & Ashcroft, F. M. (2018). Pancreatic β-cell electrical activity and insulin secretion: Of mice and men.

And frankly, general chemistry hasn’t done any favors for the deserving reputation of transition metals.   Nature’s Palette: A Brief History of Transition Metals Transition metals, the marvels of the d-block, are responsible for some of the most dazzling colors we encounter every day. These elements impart life to art, brilliance to gemstones, and paint our blood red as it courses through our veins. From the iconic blues and yellows of Van Gogh’s Starry Night to the striking greens of emerald or malachite, these metals have been coloring our world since antiquity.    Our fascination with color dates back to the Paleolithic era, when early humans used earth-derived pigments like ochre to create lasting works of art and mark ritualistic events. Rich in iron oxides, ochre pigments owe their distinct color spectrum—from yellow to deep orange or brown—to their concentration of ferric oxide (Fe2O3). Archaeologists have even found red ochre adorning Paleolithic burial sites, suggesting its symbolic role in early funerary practices. In recent excavations at the Qafzeh Cave in Israel, which uncovered some of the earliest burial sites known to date, the unforeseen findings of ochre stained artifacts prompt scientists to examine how they may reflect modern human behaviors during the Paleolithic Age. From Complexes to Colorful Life But what makes transition metals such remarkable colorants? The answer lies in their propensity to form coordination complexes, enabled by their unique structural and electronic properties. In these complexes, transition metals bond with “ligands”— molecules or ions that donate electron pairs to the metal, forming coordinate covalent bonds which stabilize the metal and create vivid colors. Consider respiratory pigments. These pigments are species specific molecules that bind oxygen, transporting it around the body. In humans, this molecule is known as hemoglobin, a tetrameric protein with four domains each containing a prosthetic heme group whose central iron atom binds oxygen. This iron center imbues blood’s red hue, which subtly shifts with respect to oxygenation levels of the blood. Interestingly, not all organisms share this symbolic red color; in horseshoe crabs, for instance, hemocyanin contains a central copper atom that binds oxygen, making their blood blue. These differences showcase the role of atomic structures of transition metals in altering reflection spectra and yielding diverse ranges of colors. Crystal Field Splitting This color chemistry hinges on a phenomenon known as crystal field splitting. Imagine an atom, its nucleus surrounded by electrons in their respective orbitals. Transition metals, uniquely, have unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals, available to accept electrons from donor molecules. When these transition metals are isolated, their d-orbitals are of equal or degenerate energy. However, when certain molecules– referred to as ligands– approach the metal ion, their interaction creates an electric field that ‘nudges’ the d-orbitals into new arrangements of unequal energies. Consider an octahedral complex, for example (refer to figure), in which a charged transition-metal is uniformly surrounded by six negative charges. In this scenario, the metal's five d-orbitals would be equal in energy due to uniform electrostatic interactions at every coordinate surrounding the metal ion. Now consider that the same metal ion is subjected to those six negative charges at the discrete vertices of an octahedral geometry. In such an arrangement, the electrostatic interactions occurring around the metal ion are no longer uniform and thus the d-orbitals are no longer degenerate, splitting into a higher-energy and lower-energy set. The higher-energy d-orbitals are those which occupy space on the same axes as the incoming ligands, resulting in larger electrostatic interactions compared to the lower-energy d-orbitals The difference in energy between these two sets is referred to as the “crystal field splitting energy.”  When an energy source providing various wavelengths– such as the white light emitted by our sun– strikes the complex, electrons in the lower-energy d-orbitals absorb wavelengths that correspond to the splitting energy of the complex, and use this energy to jump to the higher-energy level. This absorption of light produces a gap in the spectrum; the residual wavelengths– which are not absorbed by the metal– remain to be perceived by our eyes, and produce the colors we observe. Main Takeaway: Whether in Renaissance art, the natural pigments of nature, or our own biochemistry, transition metals bridge science and art, transforming the microscopic behavior of electrons into visible splendor. The next time a color captures your attention, take a moment to marvel at the transition metals spinning vibrant hues from dancing electrons and light right before your eyes.

The following work explores Complexity Science, examples of collaborations, and ways to begin to expand your systems thinking in your own work.  What is Complexity Science? How is it possible for the migration of birds, atomic fusion, and neural networks to be connected? Yes, on the surface these are wildly different phenomena that require intensive study to understand. Yet, viewed through the lens of Complexity Science, these seemingly disparate fields become unknowingly intertwined. .  Put simply, Complexity Science argues that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” More formally, Complexity Science is the study of how large networks of components interact and produce emergent phenomena that are self-organizing. Think of the brain, an extraordinarily complex system, that relies on the interactions of neurons which themselves are simplistic. We can visualize the structure of the neuron under a microscope, and we can understand its molecular components– and yet, to comprehend how such a cell can give rise to what we experience as consciousness– is inexplicable without considering the surrounding system. Complexity Science argues that understanding the interactions between individual parts, enables scientists to unearth hidden information in the system, and form a comprehensive picture of the greater reality.  Unlike some of the more “traditional” forms of sciences that are more commonly taught in academic environments, Complexity Science uniquely draws on seemingly distant and disparate disciplines. Though perhaps difficult to grasp conceptually, exploring Complexity in action can provide a clearer picture of the concept.  Mind over Matter As previously mentioned, Complexity Science describes the study of emergent phenomena from simplistic parts. One of the most prominent examples of this is human intelligence. Although we can study individual pathways and neurons, we still have no explanation for the robustness of human thought.  In the public’s eye, the term ‘neural network’ has been synonymous with Artificial Intelligence since the late 2010s revolution in Deep Learning models. The term describes the various connected layers within an algorithm that attempt to mimic the logic of a human brain. The name itself tells the story of complexity at work. Based on the work of Stanford Neurophysiologist, Warren McCollugh, many computer scientists in the 19502 began imitating the structure of the brain, and developed mathematical and computational models that could program machines to perform similar processes. Advancements were made, with one of the biggest leaps occurring when David Rumelhart, a Psychologist developed Propagated Networks, in order to extend the “thinking” to multiple layers of neurons. Now widely recognized as one of the most important advancements in the last few decades, many forget the origins of deep neural networks that helped to develop programs like ChatGPT lay in an entirely different field, illustrating the underlying inspiration that complexity sciences affords. The Art of the Connection (How to Apply Everyday) In abstract discussions, these ideas may now be clear, but you may be wondering how to apply this information in your own scientific pursuits.  Keep up with your Interests Many feel a  need to sacrifice their interests in other fields, due to the preconceived idea that a “jack of all trades” is a “master of none.” However, Complexity Science demonstrates the benefits of developing understandings in various areas. When taking classes or pursuing minors adjacent to your main field, think about how these topics might connect. Becoming an expert in one field is important, but it is likewise valuable to foment a basic understanding for surrounding disciplines. Cross-Pollinate As aspiring innovators in STEM fields, many of us will face opportunities to attend diverse conferences and events, many of which will likely focus on topics outside our specific field. Fellow Biomedical Engineers– for example– do not be afraid to learn more about insect biology and host-microbe Interactions. Public Health students don't shy away from topics like chemistry or physics.  Look outside of STEM Even beyond the diverse fields of STEM, there remains an abundance of other fields that may hold extremely lucrative information for discoveries. Economics, Music, International Affairs and Media Studies all uncover thought provoking answers to the questions of Complexity. How can the growth of cities mirror the migration of birds? How does the volatility weather patterns help predict the rise of certain stocks? Complexity Science urges us to view each of these unique subjects as part of a greater whole; as students with the opportunity to expand our breadth of knowledge, look for ways to form a more comprehensive picture of our world, by engaging with a range of disciplines. The Main Takeaway? “I think the next [21st] century will be the century of complexity"" – Stephen Hawking Complexity Science is not only an emerging interdisciplinary field, but also a thought provoking exercise in every scientist’s ability to see the bigger picture. Many problems that appear unsolvable on their surface– the origins of evolution, the cure to cancer, nuclear fusion– may in fact be solvable through cross-pollination over other fields. If anything, Complexity Science commands each of us to step outside our comfort zones and view our work in the light of others’.

Based on the work of Stanford Neurophysiologist, Warren McCollugh, many computer scientists in the 19502 began imitating the structure of the brain, and developed mathematical and computational models that could program machines to perform similar processes. Advancements were made, with one of the biggest leaps occurring when David Rumelhart, a Psychologist developed Propagated Networks, in order to extend the “thinking” to multiple layers of neurons.
