By combining deep cultural insight with scientific rigor and technological innovation, Kohrt is building more inclusive, effective, and scalable mental health systems for the future, especially in underserved communities across the globe.  When Observation Became Intervention Brandon Kohrt did not begin his career in a clinic or a lab, but instead behind a camera. As an undergraduate student at University of Southern California in the late 1990s, he journeyed to Nepal to document the reintegration of child soldiers into society following the country’s decade-long Maoist People’s War. Immersed in rural villages lacking formal healthcare infrastructure, Kohrt witnessed first-hand the extensive psychological trauma of war and the near-total absence of mental health support.  The resulting documentary, Returned: Child Soldiers of Nepal’s Maoist Army , premiered at Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre during the 2008 Artivist Film Festival, earning the Artivist Award for Children’s Advocacy and later winning Best Documentary Short at the Atlanta Underground Film Festival. Beyond acclaim, the project sparked Kohrt’s commitment to confronting the urgent question of what came next for the children he had followed on-screen. He came to see that their trauma was not isolated but reflected a far-reaching mental health crisis affecting entire communities.  In a country of nearly 23 million, with fewer than a dozen psychiatrists nationwide, most concentrated in the capital Kathmandu,  formal mental health care was almost entirely out of reach. Where services did exist, they relied on Western frameworks ill-suited to local realities. Kohrt recognized that importing Western psychiatric models was not only impractical but also risked reinforcing stigma and alienating those most in need of care. Effective solutions would need to leverage the existing social and cultural networks — families, spiritual leaders, and traditional healers — already integral to Nepali society.  Returned: Child Soldiers of Nepal’s Maoist Arm y Reimagining Mental Health Infrastructure Back in the United States, Kohrt shifted his focus to the urgent question that had emerged during his time in Nepal: how can mental health services be scaled in low-resource settings without losing cultural relevance?  To pursue this, Kohrt enrolled in a joint MD-PhD program at Emory University, where he studied psychiatry and anthropology. This dual training deepened his conviction that mental health is not only individual but fundamentally relational, inseparable from the well-being of families, social networks, and broader cultural systems that shape daily life. During his studies, Kohrt encountered the World Health Organization’s Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP), a global initiative aimed at closing the treatment gap in countries with limited psychiatric resources. One of mhGAP’s core strategies, known as “ task-sharing ,” offered a promising alternative to traditional specialist driven models. Rather than waiting for a system to produce more psychiatrists or psychologists, task-sharing trains lay providers such as non-specialist nurses, midwives, and community volunteers to identify and deliver front-line care for common mental conditions. Kohrt recognized that this approach aligned with what he had observed in Nepal: care delivered by trusted community members, grounded in local norms and relationships, was often more effective and acceptable than top-down clinical interventions. Kohrt became both a practitioner and evaluator of this strategy. In a 2025 scoping review he co-authored, Kohrt and his colleagues examined dozens of task-sharing programs across diverse global contexts. The results  were striking: beyond expanding access to care, task-sharing often elevated the social status of community health providers and increased their sense of self-efficacy. These shifts helped embed mental health services into the everyday fabric of community life, creating sustainable, culturally relevant care networks in places where formal systems had long fallen short. To further evaluate task-sharing operations in practice, Kohrt joined Ugandan colleagues on a landmark cluster-randomized trial of Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy  (IPT-G), a 16-session, evidence-based intervention originally developed to treat depression. Delivered by trained lay counselors, IPT-G helps participants link mood changes to life events and develop strategies for managing interpersonal stress. The results were dramatic: before treatment, 86% of participants met diagnostic criteria for major depression; four months later that figure had fallen to 6.5% in IPT-G villages compared to 54.7% in controls. The 79% relative reduction was sustained six months later, setting a new global benchmark for psychological interventions delivered by non-specialists in low-resource settings. Tackling Stigma from Within Despite comprehensive technical training, Kohrt observed that many lay health workers still harbored deep-seated prejudices, rooted in cultural myths or fear, against those with mental illness, often leading to missed diagnoses and inadequate care.  Drawing on the success of HIV/AIDS stigma-reduction methods, which demonstrated that structured social contact with individuals living with HIV has demonstrably shifted healthcare workers beliefs and behaviors, Kohrt partnered with people with lived experience (PWLE) of mental illness, program designers, and mhGAP trainers to co-develop RESHAPE , reducing stigma among healthcare providers. In RESHAPE modules, PWLE moves beyond static textbook examples to serve as active educators who share personal recovery narratives, provide feedback on clinical role-plays, and even serve as mentors to newly trained clinicians. This immersive approach transforms stigma-reduction into an active, relational process grounded in empathy. In Nepal, the impact was measurable. Pilot studies showed significant reductions in stigma and implicit bias, along with improved diagnostic accuracy and treatment adherence. In a 34-clinic study , real patient diagnoses were 72.5% accurate among clinicians trained with RESHAPE versus 34.5% in the implementation-as-usual arm of the study. Beyond the data, trainees reported feeling a sense of “accountability” to their PWLE mentors. By embedding structured social contact into clinical education, RESHAPE went beyond technical skill-building, fostering empathy and challenging deep-seated biases. The result was not just more skilled providers, but a more humane system of care. Integrating Technology Into Human Care Recognizing that many remote Nepali communities lack reliable roads, electricity, or supervisory oversight, Kohrt’s teams also sought to increase in-person support without overburdening already scarce human resources. To do this, they developed StandStrong , a hybrid intervention that combines a behavioral activation curriculum with passive sensing to support care delivery in hard to reach areas. The five-session curriculum helps patients identify and schedule simple, mood-lifting activities - such as going for a walk or reconnecting with others - to interrupt the cycle of depression marked by withdrawal and avoidance.  What makes StandStrong  unique is its integration of passive sensing, which uses everyday smartphone features, like GPS, Bluetooth, and microphone snippets, to collect behavioral data on movement, proximity, and ambient speech. These signals are used to generate a privacy-safe “digital phenotype”: a visual snapshot of a patient's daily routines and activity levels, captured without requiring any manual input. This data allows counselors to monitor progress remotely and tailor support in real time, even in areas where face to face supervision isn't feasible. A 2024 proof-of-concept study in Nepal involving 24 adolescent and young mothers showed meaningful improvements in depression symptoms across all participants, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory — a widely used clinical scale for assessing the severity of depressive symptoms. Counselors used color-coded heat maps generated from passive sensing data to tailor behavioral “homework” for each patient, such as encouraging a daily walk outside the home.   The results demonstrated StandStrong’s strength: using low-bandwidth technology to enrich, rather than replace, human care — making therapy more personalized, even from a distance. For rural communities with limited access to mental health services, tools like StandStrong offer more than scalability; they provide a culturally adaptable lifeline, showcasing how digital support can extend the reach of therapy without overwhelming providers. Standardizing Quality on a Global Scale As mental health task-sharing initiatives and digital therapies expanded worldwide, each tailored to unique languages, cultures, and resource levels, Kohrt identified a new critical challenge: ensuring that these varied programs maintain standards of safety and efficacy.  Together with WHO and UNICEF, Kohrt led the development of EQUIP  (Ensuring Quality in Psychosocial and Mental Health Care), a free digital platform designed to standardize training, supervision, and competency assessment across diverse settings.  At the core of EQUIP is the ENACT (Enhancing Assessment of Common therapeutic factors) checklist, and 18-item rating scale that captures essential counseling skills, such as empathy, active listening, and collaborative goal-setting. Trainees upload video recordings of actual or role-played sessions, which are then scored by remote supervisors or through semi-automated prompts; the platform flags any potentially harmful practices  such as the use of dismissive language and highlights strengths to reinforce. This structured feedback loop not only helps individual providers refine their skills but also generates aggregate data on training program performance, identifying areas where curriculum updates or additional sessions are needed. Since its public launch in March 2022, EQUIP has logged  over 10,000 competency assessments across 794 programs in 36 countries, involving more than 3,760 frontline providers. Early analyses show an 18% average improvement in observable healthcare provider skills compared to traditional lecture-based instruction. In creating a transparent, data-driven system for monitoring and enhancing counselor competencies, Kohrt ensured that scale would not come at the expense of quality.  Building a Global Hub in Washington, D.C. In Washington D.C., Kohrt serves as the Charles and Sonia Akman Professor of Global Psychiatry at George Washington University and founding director of the Center for Global Mental Health Equity , shaping a dedicated space on the Foggy Bottom campus where rigorous academic research and hands-on field experience converge.  As Scientific Co-Chair of NIH Fogarty’s Health research in Humanitarian Crises initiative and an academic partner-lead on WHO/UNICEF’s EQUIP platform, he continues to set global competency standards for non-specialist psychological care and oversees digital tools that support providers in over 40 countries.

( Image Credit ) Since 2010, Kohrt has consulted to The Carter Center’s Liberia Mental-Health Initiative , co-designing anti-stigma radio campaigns and community-nurse training curricula that now underpin the Center’s own workshops and remote coaching programs.  Through this Washington-based hub, Kohrt ensures that lessons first learned in post-conflict Kathmandu now inform cutting-edge research, policy dialogues, and scalable, equity-driven interventions around the world, completing a global-to-local cycle.  Symbiosis as a Professional Philosophy Reflecting on his journey, Kohrt often returns to a guiding principle: progress in global mental health is shaped as much by relationships as by ambition. He describes this approach as symbiotic career planning  — a philosophy that emphasizes building a path not only around personal goals, but around the people and partnerships that sustain meaningful work as well. It’s a lesson rooted in his earliest experiences in Nepal and one that continues to shape his work today. Advancing global mental health depends on connection, not just between patients and providers, but among colleagues, communities, and systems across borders.  Drawing on anthropology, implementation science, and digital innovation, Kohrt builds interventions that are deeply rooted in local contexts yet designed for global impact. For him, the most enduring solutions are those built through mutual learning, where knowledge moves in every direction and relationships define the roadmap.",,0,"en",2025-08-10T04:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""277hu368"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""From documentary filmmaker to global health pioneer, Brandon Kohrt has transformed the landscape of mental health care worldwide.

In a conversion about his journey from his graduate studies in Chemistry at Georgetown University, to his current work as a physical scientist in the Forensics Division of the United States Secret Service, Dr. Lucas Kane describes his journey exploring his interests and navigating the stressful world of career-searching to land his current position. Introduction: From Fluorine to Forensics Who: Dr. Lucas Kane is a recent graduate from Georgetown University, whose thesis work investigates carbon-fluorine bond functionalization— essentially exploring methods to break the notably strong and stable bond between carbon and fluorine, and transform it into a carbon-carbon bond— an ability with extensive and practical applications in fields like synthetic, environmental, and pharmaceutical chemistry. Kane completed his PhD at Georgetown this past summer (2024) and began his new work as a Forensic Chemist in the United States Secret Service, developing new and innovative forensic analysis methodologies. Why Unlike some of the humanities fields, science careers usually require very targeted and technical expertise, urging many students in STEM to commit to a specific field early on in their studies, before they’ve even been given a chance to explore their interests. Conversing with students who’ve carved out their own path can provide invaluable insights into the process of effectively navigating these questions throughout your studies. Early Beginnings Dr. Lucas Kane’s fascination with Chemistry began in high school, in a way most of us are familiar with: a really excellent teacher. Though initially more math and physics-oriented, Kane was inspired by Dr. Lori Kurth, his junior and senior-year Chemistry teacher: “Without Dr. Kurth, I’m not doing this.”  Fascinated by the problem-solving nature of chemistry, and the opportunity to pursue an education that delves into the molecular composition of life, Kane decided to major in Chemistry. “I didn’t know what my career would look like, but I knew that I liked chemistry, so that’s what I studied.” Pursuing a Graduate Degree: The good, the bad, the uncertainties. Midway through his undergraduate studies, as he explored his next steps, Kane’s conversation with his advisor opened him up to the idea of continuing his Chemistry education in graduate school. “We talked about graduate school, and I loved the research aspect. I love thinking creatively about how we can examine the world through the lens of chemistry, and that’s really what research is to me. I also learned that if I wanted to be trusted as an independent researcher, and if I wanted to be able to explore the world through my own ideas, I would need a PhD to be able to do that.” Finding a graduate studies program is no simple process. After applying to graduate programs in several schools, students undergo recruitment visits, in which they meet faculty who pitch their research and work. After enrolling in an institution and undergoing a semester of studies, they must select a research advisor to provide guidance as they complete their thesis research work. “It’s a little risky to go to graduate school if there’s only one group that you could really see yourself being successful in, because sometimes there’s competition to get into those groups… and if there’s five incoming students and they all want to go to that one group, you might find yourself in a situation where you feel like you don’t have a home… Georgetown was attractive for me because there were multiple places where I could see myself being successful.” Upon arriving at Georgetown, Kane joined Dr. Tim Warren’s lab, whose work investigated nitrogen reduction and ammonia oxidation chemistry. Interested in research on clean energy, Kane wanted to study nitrogen reduction for its potential applications in converting atmospheric nitrogen to clean fuel. But after two and a half years of work, Kane was required to pivot when his mentor left Georgetown. Faced with the options to either move and join Warren in Michigan, or begin anew at Georgetown, he chose the latter. Redirection: Roadblocks and finding new routes Undiscouraged by the setback, Kane began a new search for a mentor, and eventually transitioned into Dr. Christian Wolf’s lab– in the organic chemistry department. Though initially focused on inorganic synthesis, Kane credits what he calls a ‘seamless transition’ into organic chemistry, to the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry, and Wolf’s mentorship. “In Tim's lab I was doing inorganic synthesis primarily, and then I joined an organic synthesis group, but there's so much overlap there that I was really able to hit the ground running. And Christian really is the hallmark of a good mentor; somebody who is willing to go outside their comfort zone and place a great deal of trust in their colleagues— and that's what he did for me.”  In the fourth year of his graduate program, Dr. Kane’s thesis began to materialize. Transitioning towards organic synthesis strategies, he focused on carbon-fluorine bond functionalization; essentially replacing carbon-fluorine bonds with carbon-carbon bonds. Though highly available in the environment– often as pollutants– fluorinated organics are a problematic nuisance due to the high electronegativity difference between carbon and fluorine, which renders the C-F bond highly stable. Under Wolf’s guidance and support, Kane developed a strategy to cleave C-F bonds using metals like Zinc, and convert them to C-C bonds– the building blocks of organic chemistry. Future Directions— Beyond the Scientific Literature: Determining His Next Steps  Beginning With his thesis in the works, Kane– like every other student– was left to grapple with and begin planning his future. One of the challenging aspects of the process, he notes, was the uncertainty of timing in graduate school. “In grad school, there’s no set finish line. You don’t necessarily know when the end is going to arrive– because in research you can’t just say, ‘I’m going to finish this project in six months. You have no idea when it’s going to be over.’” Reflecting on his own experiences, he notes his initial anxiety to begin the job search, which caused him to procrastinate– an experience we’ve all encountered in one way or another. But, in retrospect, Dr. Kane advises students to begin the process earlier– around nine to 12 months before graduating– as a general recommendation. He also emphasizes the importance of clear communication throughout the process. Kane stressed the support and flexibility of his mentor, Dr. Wolf, throughout the uncertain timeline of the job search, which he explained required his initial transparency and clear communication. Deciding With many avenues to choose from—ranging from academic research to pharmaceuticals, environmental work, and even intellectual property– Kane was drawn to government work, and forensics, specifically. “In academia, a lot of the research that gets done is done out of curiosity, really… and I think there’s a lot of value in our academic minds, exploring our curiosity… but I wanted to see a more direct impact with the work I was doing.” That’s not to say the road to forensic chemistry was clearly defined. In graduate school, Kane says, “your career is very much what you make it.”  Reflecting on various aspects of pre-professional planning as a graduate student, he highlights two key components. Networking: Not Only Useful for the Business School Students…   “The people around you in your laboratory and in your program– those are the people that you have to pull into your network, especially people who are a little bit ahead of the game compared with you. Because in a couple of years, those are the people that you can turn to and say, ‘Hey, I need some advice.’” Describing his introduction to government work, for example, Kane mentioned the support of a student who graduated just as he joined Dr. Wolf’s group, and began work in the FDA. These relationships, he explained, helped him find opportunities and guidance. Skills: The Value of Broadening Your Expertise   “In academia, I think many would argue that your publications are the most important thing on your resume… they’re your products, really. But if you’re trying to go into industry or government work, like I did, those publications are nice, but your resume is your skillset” Kane emphasizes the importance of seeking opportunities to sharpen your skills in diverse techniques and methodologies. He notes the importance of taking initiative to find these opportunities, rather than expecting opportunities to fall into your lap.  Citing an example, he describes: “At Georgetown, for example, we have a lot of facilities for X-Ray Crystallography… and we have a full-time X-Ray Crystallographer on staff whose job is to help people do X-Ray Crystallography…. And people don’t take advantage of that, in my opinion. So the opportunities are there and the people are there, but I encourage people to take advantage of that and develop your skill set, because at the end of the day, your skill set is what will set you apart.” Many of these opportunities to hone his skills, he explained, emerged as he developed his research project. In answering his research questions, he needed to refine his expertise with certain analysis strategies. Some, like NMR and GCMS, naturally presented themselves– but others, like X-Ray Crystallography– required a willingness to explore new techniques that could elevate his research. “So when you have challenging research questions… I encourage people to try to understand what needs to be done to answer that question, and if it requires a new technique that you haven’t done, that’s not a bummer, right? That’s an opportunity to expand your knowledge and skillset.” Present Day Work: The old and the new In his current position as a physical scientist in the Forensic Division of the United States Secret Service, Dr. Kane develops novel analytical techniques for investigating forensic specimens. His colleagues contribute unique backgrounds and perspectives, ranging from chemists to biologists, engineers, physicists– as well as experts in law enforcement, the military, and more. “We all have different perspectives, thoughts and experiences, and that makes us strong as a team.”   This collaboration, which he notes as one of his favorite aspects of the job, is reminiscent of that which he experienced as a graduate student, in partnerships with other disciplines, such as immunology. In terms of adjustments and new ‘analytical hoops,’ as he calls them, Kane refers to the highly-regulated nature of federal work. “We have a to be a lot more careful and thoughtful in the ways we conduct our analysis, maintain our instrumentation, develop our protocols… everything has to be very, very tight… and it’s for good reason, because when you’re working on case, there’s a lot at stake for a human being, typically.” Final Remarks: A message to students Asked to reflect on some final suggestions to students, Dr. Kane said, “Two things come to mind.” Remove the Box “First, I would strongly recommend that you don’t put yourself in a box… It’s 100% okay to have something that you are super interested in, and that’s your thing. I think that’s good. But with that being said, I think it’s a mistake to then reject other areas, other ideas, and become so narrow, so early on. Because science is all connected, and the more you’re able to bring other disciplines into your focus, the stronger you become as a scientist.” The Obstacle Mindset “The other thing is, I feel like some of these decisions feel very monumental in the moment… for example for me, entering graduate school, which group I would end up joining felt like a monumental decision… but that ‘monumental decision’ completely crumbled halfway throughout my career… and I was sitting there thinking, ‘Am I going to have to start completely over right now? Should I just completely quit graduate school?’… and looking back on it now, I feel almost silly I had that mindset. Because if you continue to pursue your passions, if you’re motivated by a genuine interest, then there’s no reason that that type of setback has to stop you.  So that's one thing– I think perspective is so important, and looking back, I feel like no matter the rejections you get, no matter the ‘no's you get, there's so much opportunity still out in front of you that's there for the taking.” Personal Reflections & Takeaways It is unlikely that most students will follow the same exact path as Dr. Kane. With that said, his story can provide valuable insights into the process of career exploration, and transition from the world of academia to your vocational destination. In college– especially among the fields of STEM– there exists a strong culture of setting far-out goals and pursuing them methodically, by systematically checking the boxes of the pre-med/nursing/engineering– you name it– requirements and expectations. In doing so, it becomes difficult to open your eyes and mind to other possibilities, and to allow yourself to explore your own interests. This is often driven by anxieties for job stability and expectations from peers and family.  Kane’s story, however, shows the possibility for flexibility and genuine curiosity (as well as, of course, determination and hard work) to lead you on your journey to self-actualization. Motivated by a deep appreciation for Chemistry, he pursued a PhD in faith that he’ll find his calling along the way; this venture led him to a profession that, while less-traditional- incorporates his passions in an incredibly societally-contributive manner.  Kane’s story shows that by opening our eyes to the many opportunities that surround us, and letting ourselves explore our interests and passions, we may find that our aptitudes and interests converge in a different place than we initially thought.  Writing this, I am reminded of Robert Frost’s infamous poem, “The Road Not Taken,” in which he writes: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. To students currently in the process of determining future plans, let this serve as a reminder to open yourself up to new opportunities and experiences in your academic environment. With that, remember to forge relationships and a network of people, from whom you can learn and receive guidance. Aim to let yourself enjoy the process, but also challenge yourself– embrace the uncertainties and dive into them– and develop your skills and experiences; these will only aid you in your future pursuits. Lastly, take it all in proportion. Some choices are more monumental than others. That said, when one door closes, you can always find a new door to try to unlock.","{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""LEFT"",""lineHeight"":""1.6""}},""style"":{""paddingTop"":""0px"",""paddingBottom"":""0px""},""id"":""foo"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""While many scientific pursuits involve structured pre-professional programs and a clear long-term vision of your desired end goal, there are many opportunities and pathways to discover your interests and pursue a career that meets them.

As a Mechanical Engineering graduate student at George Washington University, his work spans the technical frontiers of decarbonizing energy systems while fostering international collaborations that address the pressing challenges of climate change. From his research in the Leblanc Laboratory — where he models the performance of alternative fuels in aero-derivative gas turbines — to his hands-on efforts helping communities build climate-resilient infrastructure in Sierra Leone, Wyka embodies the modern engineer: a connector of disciplines, a catalyst for innovation, and an advocate for pragmatic change. His journey, shaped by curiosity, collaboration, and a commitment to impact, continues to inspire a new generation of engineers to embrace a broader responsibility—not just to advance technology, but to create a future worth building. Introduction: Pioneering Sustainable Innovation Tyler Wyka is a current first-year Mechanical Engineering graduate student at the George Washington University School of Engineering & Applied Science (SEAS), whose work explores the potential application of alternative energy technologies in the development of new sustainable practices. Outside of the Leblanc Laboratory, Wyka additionally works directly with organizations like the Association for Energy Engineers and the Advanced Energy Group to drive a culture-oriented change in how we think about the sustainable transition. His belief in pragmatic change does not stop at GW, he said, as he also works directly with international partners in Sierra Leone and is looking to expand global collaboration to support communities of all kinds. “The US has benefited from an age of prosperity using fossil fuels to build our country… There are countries around the world not as fortunate. It feels right that we should do what we can to help.” Wyka exemplifies the qualities of a modern engineer, blending technical expertise with a broader understanding of policy and sustainability. Wyka’s story also represents the values of child-like wonder that every scientist can unlock inside themselves. And above all, he wears a smile every single day. The Big Bang On paper, Sierra Leone and New Jersey have almost nothing in common. However, Tyler Wyka eventually found himself working in both, helping to bring change from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Growing up in a small town in New Jersey as the son of a politician and an activist, Wyka often attended his father’s speeches on political reform and Garden State equality marches organized by his mother. There, Wyka developed his sensibility for the wider political world and the importance of upholding his two most defining traits to this day: curiosity and collaboration. “[My parents] instilled in me a core value to never accept the status quo if you have the power to do something,” Wyka said. His curiosity was not far behind. As a young teenager, Wyka’s favorite activities involved watching science documentaries and reading, usually focusing on space exploration or the cosmos. At age 13, Wyka attended a viewing of a Hubble Space Telescope documentary at the Jersey City Liberty Science Center. Amazed at the starry imagery and the vast depths of the universe, Wyka felt a newfound gratitude for the Earth’s existence in the cosmos, he said, and left the theater inspired. “I walked out of that big IMAX dome a changed person, in awe of my place in the Universe,” Wyka said. Being both curious about the cosmos and Congress, it was a no-brainer for Wyka to attend GWU to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, allowing him to pursue both his dreams of achieving political change and technological advancements, he said. The Catalyst During his second year of undergraduate study, Wyka joined the Design Build Fly Team, a club dedicated to constructing aircraft and attending national design competitions to showcase talented engineers. Through his experience constructing wings and analyzing flight patterns, Wyka began to envision his future at a company like NASA or SpaceX, he said, where he could achieve his lifelong dream of helping humanity reach beyond the stars. Somewhere along the way, however, he had an epiphany—one that would alter his trajectory. He realized that while the cosmos may be a vast and untapped domain, the true miracle wasn’t beyond the atmosphere; it was here, on Earth. The planet itself, a delicate and improbable oasis in the cold expanse of the universe, would be a much more rewarding problem to work on, he said. “It really is a beautiful science,” Wyka said. “Working on the environment is a much more interdisciplinary project. It’s not just the technology, but the communication and acceptance of that technology.” With this new sense of purpose, Wyka immersed himself in sustainability research at GW. He joined the Leblanc Laboratory  in 2021, where he worked on energy systems optimization research. But he didn’t stop there—science alone wouldn’t help the world’s problems. To drive meaningful change, it was essential to align policy, industry, and public perception. He took his knowledge beyond the lab, working with the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) to influence how institutions and industries approached energy transitions. From 2023 to 2024, Wyka helped lead a team of multidisciplinary students to compete in the Solar District Cup national competition hosted by NREL. The competition focused on developing a three-part plan that included policy, finance, and design, demonstrating the integrative nature of climate work. However, Wyka’s understanding of the interconnectedness of the modern world urged him to seek out collaborative opportunities outside the United States. He contacted and began a relationship with the Forum for Agriculture, Innovation and Empowerment for Children and Youth in Sierra Leone ( FAIECY-SL ) to learn about the struggles of those most impacted by the global climate crisis and how to help. FAIECY-SL, founded in 2020, is a youth-led organization working on climate resilience infrastructure and ecological innovation. After winning a grant from the Charitable Foundation of the Energy Bar Association (CFEBA) — a D.C.-based NGO focused on energy-related projects — Wyka and FAIECY-SL joined forces to construct  solar drying huts in rural communities of Sierra Leone, allowing communities to effectively preserve their harvests. Throughout his undergraduate experience, Wyka’s interests led him down many diverse paths, often not lining up with the cookie-cutter idea of an “engineer.” However, these experiences across a diverse set of passions helped Wyka grow into a successful connector of ideas and a catalyst for change. As the 2024 recipient of the GW Engineering Dean’s Alumni prize, the GW SEAS selected Wyka to speak  at commencement at the end of his undergraduate career, inspiring a new generation of engineers to embrace the broader responsibilities of both innovation and advocacy for a future worth building. A Sustainable Now! Now, as a graduate student, Wyka’s research tackles one of the most pressing challenges in sustainability: decarbonizing energy systems. His work focuses on aero-derivative gas turbines, compact and high-energy systems often used in ships, and on ascertaining how alternative fuels can impact gas turbine efficiency and reduce emissions from the United States Navy. By utilizing Python to create computer models, Wyka simulates the real-world performance of turbines operating on hydrogen and methanol-blended fuels, then compares them to traditional diesel. He incorporates Cantera, an open-source combustion simulation tool, to analyze fuel consumption, power output, and emissions. By validating his model against Arleigh Burke-class destroyers — DEFINITION —, he bridges the gap between theory and practice, ensuring that his research has real-world applications, he said. Wyka’s findings will support decarbonization research for the broader marine transport sector, which, if it were a country, falls  directly behind China, the U.S., India, the E.U., and Russia in its production of greenhouse gas emissions. If these alternative fuels prove viable, they could accelerate the maritime industry’s transition to cleaner energy sources. Overall, climate research can affect numerous areas and necessitates a broad synthesis of engineering expertise, a commitment to sustainability, and an ability to apply cutting-edge technology to real-world problems. Wyka exemplifies how working on climate change is not a simple fix, but rather a complex web of interconnected issues in almost every field of study. Tyler Wyka, at his core, is committed to advancing sustainable energy solutions in an ever-changing world. Given the complex nature of international climate change, Wyka’s work spans both local efforts in sustainable energy and international efforts in agricultural security. As he continues his graduate studies, Wyka remains a devoted individual who is quick to highlight that his path was “always forward, never straight,” he said. “I think it’s beautiful we’re given the chance to live, breathe, think, and feel. I want my work to reflect that, be a part of the solutions for a more sustainable future.”",,0,"en",2025-04-10T04:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""foo"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Tyler Wyka (GWU SEAS BS ‘24, MS ‘25) stands at the crossroads of engineering, sustainability, and global change.

Patients can experience numerous symptoms, ranging from fatigue, impaired vision, and decreased motor coordination, to memory deficits and difficulties with bowel and bladder function. Despite being one of the most common autoimmune disorders in the world, with 2.9 million people estimated to suffer from the disease in 2023, there are currently no cures available for MS. Recent advances in the field, however, offer new hope for patients. One such example is the exciting work conducted by Dr. Jeffrey Huang, whose lab at Georgetown University holds a patent for a potential new MS drug.  Based out of nation’s capital, Dr. Huang and his team at Georgetown University are targeting an amino acid transporter that they recently identified, with the goal of reducing disease severity for MS patients. In this exclusive interview, Dr. Huang shares the journey that led him to his breakthrough discovery, additional successes along the way, and the path that led him to his impactful research on MS. Introduction Dr. Jeffrey K. Huang is a Provost's Distinguished Associate Professor in the Department of Biology at Georgetown University. His lab investigates the mechanisms of remyelination—a crucial repair process in brain disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS). This work has made impactful contributions toward developing therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Having served on peer review panels for major funding agencies such as the National Institute of Health (NIH), the National MS Society, and the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, Dr. Huang is a trusted and influential figure in the field of MS research.  Beyond his scientific and medical contributions, Dr. Huang’s story serves as a powerful example of how curiosity, dedication, and mentorship can guide an uncertain start towards an impactful and fulfilling career. In an interview with The Catalyst, he shares some of the pivotal moments that shaped his career trajectory, his lab’s exciting breakthroughs and discoveries, and his candid advice for students seeking a meaningful career in science. Dr. Huang’s Research Evolution: Remyelination & Multiple Sclerosis As one of the most common autoimmune diseases in the world, with no cures discovered to date, Multiple Sclerosis has been a subject of great interest in the scientific community for decades. While the initial pathological event driving MS progression involves the infiltration of immune cells into the brain and spinal cord, symptoms of the disease primarily result from a process called “demyelination,” in which immune cells destroy myelin, an important structure in the brain that coats neurons.  Myelin – Function Similar to the insulation on an electrical wire, our brain relies on a special coating called myelin to transmit high-speed electrical signals from one neuron to the next. This structure is formed by a population of cells in the brain known as oligodendrocytes, which send out extensions of their membrane and wrap them around neurons, creating dozens of insulating layers. While brain activity is primarily mediated by neurons, which send electrical signals to one another in the form of ion currents, myelin plays a key role in the process. By preventing ions from leaking out along the neuronal membrane, this protective coating ensures smooth, lag-free conduction. Myelin enables the high-speed signaling that our brain requires to rapidly respond to information from our surroundings in real time. Myelin – Formation Myelin also provides physical protection for neurons which, in contrast to oligodendrocytes, are unable to regenerate. The brain contains a large reservoir of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which remyelinate neurons in response to injury. In healthy brains, remyelination is important to re-establish normal signaling—but in certain pathological conditions, it fails over time. In MS, specifically, patients often experience cycles of demyelination and remyelination for several years. Eventually, however, they enter a progressive stage of the disease where this natural repair process fails. Dr. Huang’s Research Journey: The Beginnings When he began his PhD at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Dr. Huang originally planned to study cancer biology. His interests took a sharp turn, however, while doing a rotation with Dr. David R. Colman, where he was first introduced to the beautiful spiral wrappings of myelin. When his mentor showed him an electron micrograph image of the structure, he was mesmerized. “I was curious about how you get this beautiful structure without anyone turning it—it just forms in the brain. That's when science really hit me in the head… When I was in Dave's lab, I realized there were questions behind anything that you see, and that you could start asking questions and exploring the unknown – The challenge of not knowing the answer, but then developing a hypothesis and solving it, was exciting.”  Not only did that experience assure Dr. Huang that he wanted to pursue a career in academic research, it sparked his deep fascination in myelin that has shaped his studies ever since. Upon completion of his PhD, Dr. Huang joined a lab at the University of Cambridge to study the mechanisms of myelin regeneration, where he shifted toward translational research on demyelinating diseases such as MS. “As an autoimmune process, you have to start learning and appreciating the complexity of the immune system… So our lab started to learn immunology, started to use immune demyelination models in mice as a way to get a bit closer to understanding disease pathology and pathogenesis in MS… I would say what sort of got us to where we are is, we found that there is this particular amino acid transporter that is involved in driving inflammation.”  A Pivotal Discovery As he analyzed the lesion environment in MS—the localized areas of damage in the brain and spinal cord due to immune cell infiltration—Dr. Huang observed an upregulation of neutral amino acids in the region. As critical metabolites, amino acids are required for many aspects of cell growth.  In his studies on immunology, Dr. Huang had learned of dysregulated amino acid transporters in other pathological conditions that cause excessive activation of immune cells. Since neutral amino acids, like those he’d observed in MS lesions, require transporters for cellular uptake, Dr. Huang wondered if inhibiting certain transporters with a drug could effectively “starve” inflammatory cells and restore a healthy environment, suitable for remyelination. “This led me to speculate–and this was purely speculation… I thought, ‘Why don't we get the drug [an inhibitor of the transporter] and add it to our model to see if it has an effect?’… And it turned out that by inhibiting this transporter, we were able to dampen inflammation and enhance repair.” To further test their hypothesis, the Huang Lab genetically modified a mouse line to “knock out” its expression of the transporter. When compared to mice that did not undergo genetic modification, those lacking the transporter showed reduced inflammation during the remyelination process. Even more strikingly, the knock-out mice exhibited an accelerated repair process. Having corroborated these findings through additional experiments, Dr. Huang and his team have shifted their focus to investigate this protein as a potential therapeutic target for MS. Their strong preclinical data, accumulated over several years of hard work, has led them to an exciting collaboration with a pharmaceutical company, and a patent for a potential drug for MS patients. The Power of Questions: A Methodological Breakthrough While the significance of the Huang Lab’s drug development work is apparent even to those unfamiliar with the field of MS research, their contributions to the study extend even further. One of the core impediments that Dr. Huang and his team faced when they began to investigate the lesion environment of MS, was an inability to identify the sites in intact tissues. “When you create a focal lesion in the mouse spinal cord, or in the brain, you don't know where that lesion is unless you section the tissue. So I wanted to be able to identify it or be able to visualize it on an intact tissue using some sort of dye.” A seemingly far-reaching goal, some lab members questioned whether it would really be possible to develop a new visualization strategy. “They were like, ‘you're just being crazy, as always,’” Dr. Huang said. “But I had an undergrad… So this is why I love undergrads: They're willing to take chances because, they're not like, trying to get a PhD out of a project. So they could take risks, and they want to learn.” With his undergraduate research assistant, David, on board, they researched numerous dyes to test on the lesions. One of the dyes they came across, called neutral red, had been used by other researchers to preferentially bind to highly acidic living cells, such as macrophages, which maintain a low pH due to their high lysosomal activity. “So I asked David to try this, and a few others,” Dr. Huang said. Through trial and error, they discovered that by injecting the mice with the neutral red two hours before sacrificing them, they could visualize the lesions without sectioning and fixing them—a process that restricts the analyses they could perform on the tissue. Then Dr. Maryna Baydyuk, an Assistant Research Professor who just joined Dr. Huang’s lab, took the project further and began to characterize neutral red labeled lesions in mice. “Once we sacrifice the mouse and take out the [spinal] cord, you can see this big red spot where we created that lesion… We can now dissect it out and then do single-cell RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry and proteomics on it… So this approach was a major, major finding in my lab that opened up so many doors because it allowed us to now characterize the lesion microenvironment and the molecular and cellular composition of lesions during remyelination.” A Mindset for Discovery: The Freedom to Fail  Professor Huang’s professional journey attests not only to the rewarding success produced through hard work and dedication, but also to the power of curiosity and a growth mindset. By leaning into the wonder that first drew him to study myelin, and seeking out important questions to probe, Dr. Huang was able to direct his intellectual passions towards tangible, meaningful impact. His journey shows that embracing the unknown, learning from failure, and allowing oneself to be captivated by a question is not only part of the process of science, but a fundamental component.  “When you're doing research, you can learn from your mistakes. That's how you get better. You have to not be afraid to do things. You have to just be ready to fail. And I say this, that for anyone who joins my lab. I always say, you're gonna fail, and you have to be okay with it. You have to mentally prepare for that… Because you're gonna do it and you'll repeat your experiments and troubleshoot several times before it works out. But that's okay as long as you're willing to keep doing it. You know, I think that's the hardest thing about research—that sort of willingness to keep going.” It is this approach that has enabled his lab’s remarkable influence on the field. Dr. Huang’s discovery of a potential new drug for MS, enabled by his willingness to explore a mere hypothesis about an amino acid transporter, and his innovative methodology for labeling MS lesions, developed through numerous trials, shows the importance of perseverance and an indifference to the prospect of failure. By pursuing abstract questions through relentless thought and experimentation, Dr. Huang is helping to spearhead progress in the field of MS research, to provide a better future for patients with neurodegenerative diseases worldwide.  Additional Information/Resources  Find more information about Dr. Huang’s research at https://www.huang-lab.com/ Also check out our past article featuring Dr. Huang!: How Cutting-Edge Research in Washington, D.C. is Reshaping Science and Medicine",,0,"en",2025-10-16T04:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""kez30452"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that damages the nervous system.

You see the crisp blue sky hanging above, watch vivacious commuters in heels hurry past or glide by on scooters in flannel suits, and notice glossy plumes of goldenrod unfurling as they spiral upward. You hear impatient cars honking from afar, catch the chirp of hungry fledglings in their nest high up in the branches, and overhear an elderly man behind his newspaper on a bench grumbling that a hot dog now costs five dollars. Filling your nostrils is the aroma of freshly brewed French-roast coffee from a corner café, mingled with buttery croissants and, if you’re unlucky, the reek of a nearby garbage truck. Despite the chaos, your entire being is locked onto one thing—the Andrew Jackson statue you came for—so you completely don’t register a guy in an inflatable T.rex strolling through the crosswalk.  Find it hard to believe? See for yourself in the video below.  Did you miss the gorilla? If so, you’re not alone. In a 1999 psychological experiment (where this video originates) by psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons, roughly half of the viewers failed to notice the gorilla despite its continuous presence for nearly nine seconds. The experiment, famously known as “The Invisible Gorilla Experiment,” tested whether a tightly-focused goal, such as counting passes, could cause people to overlook something so blatantly obvious right in front of them. What Chabris and Simons found ran counter to conventional expectations. Rather than demonstrating an all-encompassing awareness, the findings challenged long-held assumptions about attention, upending the notion that we perceive everything around us and exposing how narrow attention can be. And while the clip is visual, the same selectivity operates in hearing and smell. Think, for example, of the croissant smell from the café as you’re standing in Lafayette Square. With your attention on the statue, your mind automatically dials down irrelevant signals, even the lure of a buttery breakfast. Psychologists refer to this phenomenon as “attentional selection”, a process by which the mind prioritizes certain sensory inputs and suppresses others, thereby allocating limited processing resources where they matter least. In other words, what we focus on, and simultaneously ignore, reflects our task priorities and thus strongly shapes what we perceive and remember. This partly unconscious filtering has been a focus of research for decades. Some research has utilized behavioral and eye-tracking measures to show that people can be steered by cues they don’t consciously register. 1,2  Recent studies combining electroencephalograms (EEGs) and pupillometry (the measurement of pupil size) have begun to track such unconscious filtering more directly. 3,4     At the George Washington University, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience Dr. Sarah Shomstein takes a complementary approach. As director of the Attention and Cognition Laboratory, she pairs behavioral tasks and standardized questionnaires with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a method that tracks blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals as an indirect index of neural activity. This combination enables her to map out the brain’s labyrinth pathways that underlie behavior, providing a deeper understanding of not only the psychological tendencies but also the neurological mechanisms of attentional selection.  Dr. Sarah Shomstein (Credit: Lily Speredelozzi/GW Today) From Medicine to the Frontier of Attention Research  Dr. Sarah Shomstein did not begin her journey intending to become a neuroscientist. As an undergraduate freshman at Carnegie Mellon University in the mid-1990s, she found herself on the pre-med track. In addition to taking courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and math, she worked part-time in a psychology lab, where she studied the frontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia in a psychiatric hospital. The lab was among the first few in the U.S. to use fMRI to study cognition, and Shomstein’s role as a research assistant gave her a front-row seat to the brain’s wonders and vulnerabilities. Fascinated but realizing she didn’t want to build a career solely around treating clinical populations, she pivoted toward understanding how a “normal” nervous system operates.  That pivot quickly became a calling. By her sophomore year, Shomstein had committed to studying cognitive neuroscience and joined a lab investigating attention and perception in stroke patients with localized brain damage, some of whom presented with visual agnosia—the irreversible loss of object recognition despite intact vision. For a curious, enthusiastic young Shomstein, “that was the most interesting thing ever.” Following a summer of intense research at NYU’s Center for Neuroscience through the Howard Hughes Fellowship, she returned to her final year of college convinced that graduate school would be her next path.  By the time she completed her PhD in Cognitive and Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins University in 2003, Dr. Shomstein had been at the forefront of attention research for nearly a decade, publishing a plethora of high-impact papers that spanned psychology, neuroimaging, and computation. That vantage point gave her a panoramic view of the evolution of cognitive neuroscience. “The pace of discovery has accelerated almost exponentially. I think we now have a better handle on the basic cognitive function. And now is a really exciting time where we can ask more complex questions about the brain,” Dr. Shomstein said, noting that recent breakthroughs have pushed the boundary of inquiry beyond the basics toward higher-order cognitive functions. Among the most intensively studied domains is decision-making, as it is central to identity, agency, and survival. With the advent of new technologies and tools that enable scientists to probe the brain with greater precision and scale, questions about consciousness and the mechanisms that support decision-making are coming into sharper focus.  One key mechanism driving decision-making is attention. “For the past 30 years, we’ve tried to map the regions involved in attention,” Dr. Shomstein said. As we focus on places, objects, or patterns in our environment, different circuits in the brain compute those signals before fusing them into what Dr. Shomstein calls an “attentional priority map,” a running shortlist of what matters now. Without that triage, she added, “it’s too much information. Our brain can’t process it all.” In other words, by narrowing the flood of sensory and internal information, attention provides us with a manageable, prioritized set of options. This filtering system ultimately forms the basis on which we make a choice. Without that selective gatekeeping, decision-making would be slower, noisier, and far less accurate.  Mapping a Labyrinth Dr. Shomstein’s early fMRI work helped pin down how the brain allocates attention across senses and space. In one foundational study, she and her team cued people to shift attention between vision and audition and found increased activity in the auditory cortex when attention moved to sound while the visual cortex quieted, and vice versa. 5  This showed that the brain doesn’t run everything at full blast all the time; it turns dials up and others down depending on what you’re trying to notice. Building on this discovery, Dr. Shomstein published another paper showing that the posterior parietal cortex supports two kinds of attention at once: “where” something is and “what” something is. It works with a wider control system to switch between those priorities as the task changes. Think of it like a smart scoreboard that constantly ranks what’s most important and sends your attention there when several things compete for your eyes and mind. A decade later, Dr. Shomstein and her colleagues pulled together results from brain scans in people and physiology studies in animals and proposed  a simple case: the brain’s “priority map” in parietal cortex doesn’t just track where things are. 6  It also tracks what matters (like a face, a color, or a moving object). Even those “what” priorities end up being handled in a way the brain can use for aiming attention in space. This helps explain why goals like “find the red jacket” still show up as location-based patterns in the brain during real tasks. Visual processing in the brain divides into two main streams: the dorsal (“where”) pathway, which projects upward to the parietal lobe and processes spatial location and motion, and the ventral (“what”) pathway, which projects downward to the temporal lobe and identifies objects and their features. (Image adapted from Ventral and Dorsal Streams of Visual Information  in Introduction to Neuroscience  by the University of Utah) Bringing Context Back Into Focus In her recent line of research, Dr. Shomstein and her team set out to challenge one of attention science’s bedrock assumptions: that “task-irrelevant” information is simply ignored by the brain. In their recent Nature paper titled “Task-Irrelevant Semantic Relationship Between Objects and Scene Influences Attentional Allocation,” 7  they showed that objects semantically consistent with a scene attract attention, even when they’re irrelevant to the task, and that this “fits-the-scene” advantage is detectable in early visual brain activity. Imagine you’re waiting at a crosswalk, focused on the “walk” signal. You think you’re tuning out everything else—the parked cars, trees, shop signs, chatter of passers-by—but your visual system is still quietly organizing all of that. In their study, participants viewed scenes like offices, bathrooms, and kitchens while performing a simple visual task. When the target appeared on an object that ‘fit’ the scene (like a computer mouse in an office or toothpaste in a bathroom), responses were faster than when it appeared on an object that didn’t belong. The finding suggests there may be no such thing as truly “irrelevant” information; even background details we’re not acting on still shape the early stages of perception and, ultimately, what we become aware of.  For Dr. Shomstein, the driver isn’t about words so much as lived experience. “It’s about you knowing that these things are related,” she said. “It has nothing to do with language itself. It has to do with your knowledge of that.” In other words, it isn’t about words, but learned pairings: we know a mouse goes with a computer, a plant with its pot, a brush with lipstick. Attention rides on that conceptual knowledge, so even without language, anyone can have the same experience as long as they have encountered two objects that co-occur often together. Dr. Shomstein and her team pushed this idea further in a second study, “Predicting Attentional Allocation in Real-World Environments: The Need to Investigate Semantic Guidance.” 8 Across four experiments, her lab demonstrated that the semantic associations we carry across sight, sound, and even smell have a compounding bias effect on attention in real-world settings. When all of those signals line up, we’re quick to recognize and pay attention to a target object. “Our environments are multi-sensory,” Dr. Shomstein said. “It’s not just a picture. When you walk into a café, it’s the sound, the smells, and other environmental signals that impinge on you that help you find the cookie or understand where your friend might be sitting.” Dr. Shomstein argued that we can’t understand a cognitive function by studying vision, or any other sense, in isolation. Instead, we need to expand the current tidy, single-sensory experiments that dominate traditional research by integrating multiple senses to better capture naturalistic behavior and develop multisensory accounts of attention. Looking Ahead: The Human-AI Frontier After 25 years in the field, Dr. Shomstein sees the next phase of attention research as delivering a fuller account of how attention works and turning those insights into better training, smarter interfaces, and practical habits for focusing in an age of constant digital distractions. As machine learning has surged in recent years, AI’s presence is unmistakable, and so are its effects on cognitive performance and attention spans. In medicine, security, and other high-stakes fields, AI is being used for monotonous, time-consuming tasks, from medical imaging to surveillance footage, to flag abnormalities for human review.  Psychologists measure changes in pupil size as a physiological indicator of trust and social interactions (Image from Kret, M.E. & De Dreu, C.K.W. (2018). Pupil-mimicry conditions trust in partners: Moderation by oxytocin and group membership . Evolution and Human Behavior. ) One question that arises is how this would shape, sharpen, or skew our focus. “The person's attention is affected by the help from the intelligent agent,” Dr. Shomstein said. In some cases, she noted, trusting the AI can yield amazing results, such as catching a subtle cancerous lesion or a flicker in a dark corner of a video. In other cases, over-trusting the AI can tunnel attention to its cues, causing unflagged problems to be missed. In her lab, Dr. Shomstein and her team are adapting measures from social psychology, such as pupillometry, to study whether a person’s body physiological state reveals when they’re over- or under-relying on machine suggestions. “What we're trying to understand right now in the lab is whether we can measure the size of the pupil as a measure of trust.” A Collective Endeavor Dr. Shomstein emphasizes that science is a team sport. “We do it together,” she said. In her lab, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows are co-investigators, not just assistants, training to ask their own complex questions and developing novel approaches to find the answers. This collaborative ethos mirrors the very phenomenon she studies: separate systems working together, integrating multiple signals to produce something greater than the sum of its parts. By tracing how the brain edits reality on the fly, Dr. Shomstein is pushing the science of attention toward multi-sensory environments where we actually live. In doing so, she is helping to redraw the map of how we see and what we miss in an age when our perceptual worlds are more crowded, more mediated, and more augmented than ever before.",,0,"en",2025-10-09T04:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""b47o1406"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Through novel experiments and cutting-edge brain imaging, Dr. Sarah Shomstein reveals how our mind silently sorts the sensory chaos around us—and what it means for everyday attention. "",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""type"":""DIVIDER"",""id"":""l60i6421"",""nodes"":[],""dividerData"":{""containerData"":{""textWrap"":false,""height"":{},""spoiler"":{},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""width"":{}},""lineStyle"":""SINGLE"",""width"":""LARGE"",""alignment"":""CENTER""}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""nagg3543"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""m3czx434"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Imagine walking through Lafayette Square in Washington, DC, on a chilly fall morning.

I think we now have a better handle on the basic cognitive function. And now is a really exciting time where we can ask more complex questions about the brain,” Dr. Shomstein said, noting that recent breakthroughs have pushed the boundary of inquiry beyond the basics toward higher-order cognitive functions. Among the most intensively studied domains is decision-making, as it is central to identity, agency, and survival. With the advent of new technologies and tools that enable scientists to probe the brain with greater precision and scale, questions about consciousness and the mechanisms that support decision-making are coming into sharper focus. "",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""gw93d469"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""kmhgr470"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""One key mechanism driving decision-making is attention. “For the past 30 years, we’ve tried to map the regions involved in attention,” Dr. Shomstein said.

Without that triage, she added, “it’s too much information. Our brain can’t process it all.” In other words, by narrowing the flood of sensory and internal information, attention provides us with a manageable, prioritized set of options. This filtering system ultimately forms the basis on which we make a choice.

The finding suggests there may be no such thing as truly “irrelevant” information; even background details we’re not acting on still shape the early stages of perception and, ultimately, what we become aware of. "",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""oj76k502"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""hrlia503"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""For Dr. Shomstein, the driver isn’t about words so much as lived experience. “It’s about you knowing that these things are related,” she said. “It has nothing to do with language itself.

In other cases, over-trusting the AI can tunnel attention to its cues, causing unflagged problems to be missed.

For young children with speech delays and the caregivers who support them, Dr. Amy Yeboah Quarkume is working to make this vision a reality.  Dr. Quarkume (“Amy Yeboah Quarkume, Ph.D.”) Dr. Quarkume, an accomplished scholar, data scientist, associate professor at Howard University, and director of the CORE Futures Lab, is—among a myriad of other projects—using AI in innovative ways to make speech therapy more accessible to children and their families. Her new AI-based program is called Worlds of Hello. “Worlds of Hello is an AI-powered platform that connects families with therapy, allowing them to support their child and find their voice,” Dr. Quarkume explained. “We focus on children with speech delays.” It started as a passion project inspired by her nephew, who has a speech delay, and the challenges her family faced in getting the support he needed—particularly with a shortage of speech therapists. “We all try to help him, but there’s a three-month wait on therapists, and there’s only a thirty-minute session generally a week, and we wanted more.” ( Worlds of Hello ) Seeing this issue unfold in her own family, Dr. Quarkume and a few of her like-minded students came together to build Worlds of Hello. “It is our way to allow families to create personalized lessons for their children to find their voice. So you’ll hear your mom’s voice or your dad’s voice, or you’ll see your mom’s face, your dad’s face, or a family member’s face.”  The idea was simple enough: “When we first started, we felt it was like sending an audio file to your child on a phone, they hear your voice, and they start talking,” she explained, with the primary motive to speak being the comfort of hearing a familiar voice. “What we have right now is more dynamic, more engaging. There’s storytelling, there’s gamification, there is, again, AI in there that helps parents clone their voice.”  The app includes various lessons and activities that prompt children to practice speaking. It strives to create the perfect balance between promoting speech development and gamification, with animations that make it enticing for young children. It also allows families to be actively involved in their child’s learning, and for clinicians to monitor both caregiver and child usage. Dr. Quarkume’s team now includes speech therapists who work to emulate practices used in live sessions in the digital program. ( Worlds of Hello ) Worlds of Hello also builds this sense of familiarity by accounting for linguistic diversity, particularly different accents and dialects. Its users can select from various dialects used in different parts of the country, allowing children to learn a language as they hear it around them. “So if your mom has an accent, and she wants to use her voice, there you go. If your dad has an accent, they use their voice, there you go,” Dr. Quarkume said. The goal is to expand and include other languages as well. The program is currently undergoing beta testing, a process to prepare it for future broad consumption. The team is currently offering paid testing opportunities for families with young children with speech delays and speech therapists to test both sides of the program. But the road to this point hasn’t been easy; funding has been a constant hurdle. The project has received a Phase I grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), but is still facing funding difficulties. At this moment, the team continues to search for solutions to further their research and development. Dr. Quarkume explained how difficult it is for Black women in particular to fund their businesses—less than 1% of companies founded by Black women receive venture capital or similar financial support. She also noted the challenges of data privacy, especially for children, the costs associated with software and AI development, and the environmental impact of AI. However, she is hopeful about the project’s next steps: exploring avenues to complete the research and development, resolving any remaining bugs or issues, and bringing Worlds of Hello to market. For Dr. Quarkume, it’s exciting to see the potential gains for families and the way it can support them. “It works—that children will see their family members in their learning environment and be drawn to speak and overcome their challenges, and that parents will feel comfortable contributing to their child’s learning journey, because it does take time and most parents are busy, right?” The possibility of expanding similar technology beyond pediatrics is also an exciting prospect, and she has received inquiries about doing so in areas such as geriatrics. “Voice technology has been here for a while,” she said, but described how her team wants to find its unlocked potential. “It’s just, where hasn’t  it gone that we can kind of support?” “If one child can speak or doesn't have trouble with speaking, it just makes the world better because that child can be productive and give back to their community as a citizen,” Dr. Quarkume shared. “So even though the work isn't considered top priority, some of us are still doing it because we know that the impacts supersede the communities that we’re working with,” referring to young children with speech delays. “It will benefit everyone if we still continue [to work] on these challenges.”",,0,"en",2025-11-26T05:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""87jmd1860"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""What if your child with a speech delay could receive regular, consistent, and even fun speech support in your own home—guided by the sound of your own voice?

Leveraging his unique position in Washington D.C., Professor Cahill has advanced the field's understanding of these f-block elements while shaping discourse on their potential involvement in nuclear policy.  An Unconventional Start in STEM: From Music to Materials Science Professor Cahill’s journey into science began as a digression from his intended trajectory into music. Soon after enrolling at SUNY Fredonia, his band teacher’s alma mater, his aspiration to become a band teacher faltered when he realized he had been fueled by undue praise and lacked the skill to excel at the collegiate level of music.  ""Being a high school star didn't translate to college, and I lacked the talent needed. It was humbling."" But just as one door closed, another opened. On the day of course registration, Cahill happened to be in line next to chemistry professor James Bowser, who recommended that Cahill take a few core science classes. Despite the radical pivot, with just one introductory course in chemistry and another in geology, he was hooked - acquiring a BS in Chemistry and Geochemistry and igniting a lifelong passion. Inspired by the mentorship of chemist John B. Parise during an undergraduate research internship at Stony Brook University, Cahill would apply to Parise’ lab again to pursue a PhD in Chemistry. Surrounded by like-minded, intellectually engaging individuals at Stony Brook and with access to Brookhaven National Lab, a Department of Energy facility, Cahill cultivated his zeal for crystallography and materials chemistry. Driven by his love for chemistry and interest in crystals and minerals, Cahill pursued a postdoc in the Environmental Mineralogy Group at Notre Dame University, where he worked on characterizing natural uranium minerals to consider their potential applications in nuclear waste storage or geologic repositories. Following his postdoc, Cahill joined GWU as a professor, where he taught coursework in chemistry and international affairs and was the principal investigator of a laboratory focused on solid-state and materials chemistry. The Charm of Crystals and Hybrid Materials With a curious fascination in Geology and Chemistry, Professor Cahill developed an interest in crystallography, the perfect unifier of these two scientific branches. Applying the principles of crystallography and its derived tools, it became possible to research and characterize hybrid materials.  Hybrid materials are synergistic combinations of inorganic and organic constituents on a molecular scale. This relatively novel area of research is rapidly expanding and presents a compelling challenge to synthesize materials with enhanced functionality and performance for innovative applications. While their inorganic components provide a stable and rigid framework, the organic components enable flexibility to customize novel or enhanced materials with unique properties. Expanding the library of synthetic hybrid materials requires optimizing the approach of assembling chemical constituents to maximize the synergy of organic-inorganic frameworks. Cahill’s lab specializes in uranyl-containing hybrid materials; his group probes properties such as second-sphere effects, energy transfer, or luminescence to better understand their behaviors and potential applications.  Working with his graduate and undergraduate students, Cahill views his lab’s collaborative effort as a contribution to what he calls the ‘intellectual forum’ of actinides, in which members hone skills in crystallography and nuclear chemistry.    Bridging Science and Policy As a professor in both Chemistry and International Affairs, Cahill has contributed his efforts to bolstering the intersection between these disciplines to address global nuclear issues while nourishing his own curiosities. In the Elliott School of International Affairs, his course “Science of Nuclear Materials” empowers non-scientific students interested in the nuclear arena with the basics of nuclear chemistry, expanding their capacity to put forth influential, informed policy.  Throughout his time serving as a Science Fellow at the American Institute of Physics in the US State Department’s Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism within the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, Cahill developed his understanding of how policy can help shape scientific initiatives. This experience informed his teaching and inspired his commitment to train a new generation of “hybrid thinkers” capable of navigating the intersection of science and policy. Cahill aims to remain involved and active in shaping the future policymakers at GW and using his diverse background to encourage scientifically minded students to consider roles in policy-making. His collaborative efforts with national labs, governmental organizations, and other universities ensure that scientific input remains a fundamental part of international policy discussions. Mentoring Future Innovators Reflecting on his own transformative experiences, Professor Cahill is a passionate advocate for mentorship and providing meaningful guidance to students.

But the unexpected shift into science—sparked by a low-chance encounter with a chemistry professor—opened the door to a rewarding career that completely changed his life and that of countless students. “When one door closes, another always opens, but we usually look so long, so intently and so sorrowfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one that has opened."" — Jean Paul Richter Cahill’s story highlights the importance of staying open to unexpected opportunities and knowing how to pivot when necessary. Allow yourself to explore unfamiliar academic territories. Don’t be discouraged when an initial plan doesn’t pan out. Instead, trust that a different opportunity will come along, often in ways you never imagined. Build a Broad Foundation Don’t limit yourself to a single focus or interest.

Leveraging his unique position in Washington D.C., Professor Cahill has advanced the field's understanding of these f-block elements while shaping discourse on their potential involvement in nuclear policy.  An Unconventional Start in STEM: From Music to Materials Science Professor Cahill’s journey into science began as a digression from his intended trajectory into music. Soon after enrolling at SUNY Fredonia, his band teacher’s alma mater, his aspiration to become a band teacher faltered when he realized he had been fueled by undue praise and lacked the skill to excel at the collegiate level of music.  \""Being a high school star didn't translate to college, and I lacked the talent needed. It was humbling.\"" But just as one door closed, another opened. On the day of course registration, Cahill happened to be in line next to chemistry professor James Bowser, who recommended that Cahill take a few core science classes. Despite the radical pivot, with just one introductory course in chemistry and another in geology, he was hooked - acquiring a BS in Chemistry and Geochemistry and igniting a lifelong passion. Inspired by the mentorship of chemist John B. Parise during an undergraduate research internship at Stony Brook University, Cahill would apply to Parise’ lab again to pursue a PhD in Chemistry. Surrounded by like-minded, intellectually engaging individuals at Stony Brook and with access to Brookhaven National Lab, a Department of Energy facility, Cahill cultivated his zeal for crystallography and materials chemistry. Driven by his love for chemistry and interest in crystals and minerals, Cahill pursued a postdoc in the Environmental Mineralogy Group at Notre Dame University, where he worked on characterizing natural uranium minerals to consider their potential applications in nuclear waste storage or geologic repositories. Following his postdoc, Cahill joined GWU as a professor, where he taught coursework in chemistry and international affairs and was the principal investigator of a laboratory focused on solid-state and materials chemistry. The Charm of Crystals and Hybrid Materials With a curious fascination in Geology and Chemistry, Professor Cahill developed an interest in crystallography, the perfect unifier of these two scientific branches. Applying the principles of crystallography and its derived tools, it became possible to research and characterize hybrid materials.  Hybrid materials are synergistic combinations of inorganic and organic constituents on a molecular scale. This relatively novel area of research is rapidly expanding and presents a compelling challenge to synthesize materials with enhanced functionality and performance for innovative applications. While their inorganic components provide a stable and rigid framework, the organic components enable flexibility to customize novel or enhanced materials with unique properties. Expanding the library of synthetic hybrid materials requires optimizing the approach of assembling chemical constituents to maximize the synergy of organic-inorganic frameworks. Cahill’s lab specializes in uranyl-containing hybrid materials; his group probes properties such as second-sphere effects, energy transfer, or luminescence to better understand their behaviors and potential applications.  Working with his graduate and undergraduate students, Cahill views his lab’s collaborative effort as a contribution to what he calls the ‘intellectual forum’ of actinides, in which members hone skills in crystallography and nuclear chemistry.    Bridging Science and Policy As a professor in both Chemistry and International Affairs, Cahill has contributed his efforts to bolstering the intersection between these disciplines to address global nuclear issues while nourishing his own curiosities. In the Elliott School of International Affairs, his course “Science of Nuclear Materials” empowers non-scientific students interested in the nuclear arena with the basics of nuclear chemistry, expanding their capacity to put forth influential, informed policy.  Throughout his time serving as a Science Fellow at the American Institute of Physics in the US State Department’s Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism within the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, Cahill developed his understanding of how policy can help shape scientific initiatives. This experience informed his teaching and inspired his commitment to train a new generation of “hybrid thinkers” capable of navigating the intersection of science and policy. Cahill aims to remain involved and active in shaping the future policymakers at GW and using his diverse background to encourage scientifically minded students to consider roles in policy-making.

Forest Fire, Wildfire burning tree in red and orange color. Photo by yelantsevv From fires and floods to unprecedented scalding temperatures in worldwide locations, global climate change is becoming an increasingly pressing issue. The scientific community must find ways to address it. Despite the already-palpable implications, factors such as technological advances, convenience, and political motives all impede on the ability to mitigate the accumulating damage to the environment. While societal change can be idealized at the individual level, the urgency of global climate change demands pragmatic initiative and creativity to implement structural changes. In recent years, Professor Song Gao from Georgetown University’s Department of Chemistry has worked to battle environmental systems’ damage and promote sustainability on a broader scale: international policy. From Synthetic Chemistry to Atmospheric Chemistry Throughout his undergraduate studies, Dr. Gao was primarily focused on synthetic chemistry. With a long-held passion for the environment, though, he pursued polymer synthesis, seeking to develop cleaner materials for energy storage. When he began his search for a graduate program, though, his interests drew him to PhD advisors at the University of Washington, and later his postdoctoral mentors at Caltech, to work on broader environmental science issues — in particular, atmospheric chemistry. There, Dr. Gao began researching the effects of aerosols on air pollution and the climate. While scientists had understood some of their harmful effects on air quality, they were just beginning to decipher the climate impacts of organic aerosols, especially, in both reflecting sunlight (a direct impact) and influencing the formation of clouds (an indirect impact). The Montreal Protocol and Policy Influence While Dr. Gao’s focus on air pollution and climate change has remained strong, a pivotal encounter in 2016 inspired him to consider incorporating a new angle to his work. A group of science-based policy makers asked Dr. Gao to write a review article on stratospheric ozone depletion and its implications on the regulation of chlorofluorocarbons, better known as CFCs. These molecules, which have been widely used as refrigerants, coolants and fire extinguishers since the 1940s, were discovered to play a massive role in the destruction of the ozone layer in the 1970s — a finding so consequential that it won Crutzen, Molina, and Rowland, the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Due to their stable C-F and C-Cl bonds, CFCs are mostly inert in the lower atmosphere and resistant to degradation efforts. Upon traveling to the upper atmosphere, however, the sun’s ultraviolet radiation breaks these covalent bonds. The resulting Cl and Br radicals deplete the earth’s ozone layer, inhibiting its function of filtering the most cancerous and dangerous wavelengths of ultraviolet light from reaching biological life on earth’s surface. The Rowland-Molina theory of ozone depletion. As awareness of their harm grew, the United Nations signed the Montreal Protocol in 1987 to phase out the use of CFCs. Often considered the UN’s most successful international agreement, the Montreal Protocol has eliminated approximately 99% of ozone-depleting substances in the environment.  Following that initial collaboration with science policymakers, Dr. Gao became aware of the massive potential for widespread influence by incorporating clever policy into scientific work.   “I realized that for science to truly improve society and safeguard the environment, it must interface with policy effectively,” he said. “That realization has influenced my approach ever since.”  Although rooted in science, environmental policy — as with everything related to government affairs — is strongly influenced by politics. In Chemical Transformations in the Environment , a course Dr. Gao teaches at Georgetown, he highlights “the three Ps” that underlie effective environmental policy: people, planet, and profit.  “If one aspect is ignored, the entire system becomes unworkable. If policies or solutions negatively impact people’s livelihoods or cause economic losses, they won’t be accepted. If, however, the focus is solely on profits and politics while polluting the environment, that’s unsustainable. And if we protect the environment but ignore economic or social factors, the approach is too naïve to be effective,” he said. “Sustainability requires integrating all three.” The ingenious approach of the Montreal Protocol, according to Dr. Gao, was its unprecedented flexibility and consideration for the “three Ps.” Since its initial ratification, it has been amended more than 20 times to incorporate new scientific findings and the differing on-the-ground realities that various countries face. Other international agreements like the Paris Agreement, which demanded rigid, often-quantified commitments, and imposed higher economic costs, have shown much less success.   Current Work Nitrous oxide emissions from wastewater treatment systems. Although highly successful at eliminating ozone depletion, the Montreal Protocol showed an unexpected outcome. While the ozone layer was showing signs of replenishment, some of the replacements for CFCs — particular HFCs and HCFCs — posed a separate issue: climate warming. In light of this discovery, 163 parties signed the 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, agreeing to phase out HFCs as well. Despite these efforts, however, air quality data from recent years  has shown increasing concentrations of certain CFCs and HFCs in the environment pointing to undisclosed, potentially illicit use. Continued emissions of these substances seriously hinder the ongoing efforts to combat climate change and ozone depletion. Consequently, in 2021, Dr. Gao took action and partnered with Dr. Stephen Anderson — one of the founders of the famous Montreal Protocol and a prominent figure in environmental policy — on a highly influential paper  addressing this issue. Through extensive research, Dr. Gao and his collaborators revealed a potential loophole in the Protocol that allows exemptions of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) for “critical uses” in medicine, manufacturing, and other applications. Growing evidence indicates misuse and overuse of these exemptions for non-critical purposes, which also may include plastics production. In their work, Dr. Gao and Dr. Anderson identified multiple pathways by which some ODSs and HFCs may be converted into fluoropolymers, like Teflon. In their paper they offer actionable recommendations for further amending the Montreal Protocol in order to more effectively prevent exploitation of its exemptions and to maximize its success at battling multiple and inter-linking environmental damages.  Bringing Science into Action: The Role of Policy in Environmental Research Dr. Gao’s work highlights a key but often overlooked application for science-oriented work. Although most discoveries are made in the lab, there is vast potential for wider influence through interdisciplinary work. There exists a problematic gap in science communication that limits the accessibility of breakthrough research to people outside the field, and prevents widespread implementation of crucial scientific developments.  “Understanding policy has influenced the kinds of scientific questions I pursue. If you want your research to have real-world impacts, it’s important to study science that is relevant to policy and societal needs,” Dr. Gao said. Takeaways For Students To the readers here, at the heart of the nation’s capital, consider Dr. Gao’s message: “Right now, science and policy are not as integrated as they should be. Scientists and policymakers are often curious about each other’s fields, but there aren’t many structured pathways for collaboration,” he said. “That’s why I encourage students to study both. A strong foundation in chemistry, ecology, mathematics and atmospheric science is essential. But it’s equally important to develop skills in scientific communication and environmental policy. Having expertise in both allows for an effective convergence of the two.” As is made clearer every day, the worsening condition of the environment demands scientific minds to collaborate towards discovering innovative solutions, and often tweak existing solutions. While climate change is an undoubtedly urgent issue, environmental science is one of many fields in STEM that can benefit from interdisciplinary collaboration and communication. This field allows for a positive impact on the world through science and a wide scope of influence, even if the means are unconventional.  References Molina, M., Rowland, F.

While scientists had understood some of their harmful effects on air quality, they were just beginning to decipher the climate impacts of organic aerosols, especially, in both reflecting sunlight (a direct impact) and influencing the formation of clouds (an indirect impact)."",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""bjh19398"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""DIVIDER"",""id"":""yr2sh397"",""nodes"":[],""dividerData"":{""containerData"":{""textWrap"":false,""height"":{},""spoiler"":{},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""width"":{}},""lineStyle"":""SINGLE"",""width"":""LARGE"",""alignment"":""CENTER""}},{""style"":{},""id"":""v3g1p410"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""The Montreal Protocol and Policy Influence"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700},{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}}],""headingData"":{""level"":2,""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""type"":""HEADING""},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""l1xa2445"",""nodes"":[],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""148r9412"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""While Dr. Gao’s focus on air pollution and climate change has remained strong, a pivotal encounter in 2016 inspired him to consider incorporating a new angle to his work. A group of science-based policy makers asked Dr. Gao to write a review article on stratospheric ozone depletion and its implications on the regulation of chlorofluorocarbons, better known as CFCs. These molecules, which have been widely used as refrigerants, coolants and fire extinguishers since the 1940s, were discovered to play a massive role in the destruction of the ozone layer in the 1970s — a finding so consequential that it won Crutzen, Molina, and Rowland, the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Due to their stable C-F and C-Cl bonds, CFCs are mostly inert in the lower atmosphere and resistant to degradation efforts. Upon traveling to the upper atmosphere, however, the sun’s ultraviolet radiation breaks these covalent bonds.

Climate change and other forms of environmental degradation pose serious development threats to children, as they are more biologically vulnerable than adults. At the same time, they also tend to disproportionately harm racially marginalized populations, which is often an ongoing result of discriminatory historical practices—a phenomenon known as environmental racism. Children in marginalized communities are thus at the center of this dangerous intersection, and those in D.C. are no exception. Children walking past an industrial facility in Brentwood, a historically Black D.C. neighborhood (Fears, 2021) Historical Background Environmental racism in the U.S. today is often a result of discriminatory housing practices that began as early as the 1930s. In 1933, the U.S. federal government established the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC) in response to the Great Depression, which created a zoning system that categorized neighborhoods across the country from desirable (or “green”) to hazardous (or “red”), which became known as redlining. Redlining led to racist policies that prevented Black people from buying homes in certain “green” areas, and highways were often built to further separate redlined neighborhoods and communities of color. Even today, formerly redlined areas have less green space, higher levels of air pollution, and higher surface temperatures than those rated “green” nearly a century ago.  Present day macro-social factors continue to promote and exacerbate racism, which is becoming even more dangerous in the context of climate change. Discrimination in zoning laws and housing markets keep people of color concentrated in the same polluted areas and make it difficult for them to move elsewhere. This further perpetuates power differences and limits these populations from being involved in decision-making about hazardous pollution sites. These areas face notable environmental hazards, such as higher heat indices, increased exposure to noise, air, and water pollution, and decreased access to resources such as food, green space, healthcare, transportation, and social services. Children are also still seeing the effects of historical redlining today; for instance, a 2020 study found that rates of asthma-related emergency room visits were 2.4 times higher for children living in previously redlined areas in eight different California cities (Nardone et al., 2020), and a 2017 study found higher levels of both indoor and outdoor air pollution in New Jersey zip codes with a majority Black population (Alexander & Currie, 2017). What makes children vulnerable? The climate crisis threatens all humans, but children are particularly at risk. Four key development factors drive this vulnerability: consumption, as children eat, drink, and breathe more per pound of body weight than adults do; contact, as children often engage in behaviors like putting their hands in their mouths; immunity, as children’s immune systems are not yet as strong as those of adults; and exposure time, given that children have more time to develop health conditions from early exposure. Children’s developing bodies also take longer to process and remove toxic materials they have ingested, meaning that pollutants remain in their bodies longer than they do in adults. Because of this, children face immediate threats like increased risk of infectious disease, exposure to extreme temperatures and weather events, and adverse mental health impacts such as PTSD and climate anxiety. Indirect effects include exposure to conflict, shortage of resources, malnutrition, or climate-driven migration. And these impacts can be deadly: the World Health Organization found that environmental hazards were responsible for 26% of global deaths among children younger than five years old in 2017. Residents from Buzzard Point, a predominantly Black D.C. neighborhood, protesting the groundbreaking of the DC United Soccer Stadium (Fulton, 2016) How does environmental racism affect children? These environmental hazards not only threaten all children, but disproportionately harm children of color and of lower socioeconomic status. These children tend to face higher levels of air pollution, as they are more likely to live in historically redlined neighborhoods. Many also live near other sources of pollution such as busy roads or factories, and walk to school or use public transportation, increasing their exposure to outdoor air pollution. They are often subject to higher levels of indoor air pollution as well, as they are more likely to live in smaller homes with more people and less ventilation; they also may not have a separate kitchen and living space, increasing exposure to cooking fuels and other air pollutants. Ingesting air pollutants can have adverse respiratory effects, varying from sickness and infections to more serious issues like developmental delays, mental health issues, or even changes to DNA methylation. This disparity extends to other hazards as well, such as lead exposure. Black children in the U.S. are exposed to significantly higher levels of lead than any other racial group, and there is no safe level of lead exposure in early childhood development. These children often ingest lead-based paint in houses built before 1978, another result of structural racism in housing practices resulting from historical redlining.  Water pollution is another threat; the 2014 water crisis in Flint, Michigan—a majority Black and low-income community—is often cited as a prime example of environmental racism. Only weeks after Flint officials switched the city’s water source prematurely, residents began complaining about the water quality and resulting adverse health effects—yet it still took over a year to be acknowledged and addressed. An estimated 9,000 children under age six were exposed to lead-contaminated water for 18 months. Affected Flint residents also saw a 12% drop in fertility rates and 58% increase in fetal mortality related to the change in water supply. More broadly, it is clear that environmental racism only perpetuates a vicious cycle. Racism worsens adverse impacts of environmental problems: factors such as poverty, maternal financial hardship, and poor diet can amplify the toxic effects of air pollution and other exposure to chemicals on children’s cognitive abilities. Environmental racism also exacerbates poverty, as those who live in poverty are more likely to be exposed to environmental hazards, subjecting them to more adverse health outcomes. This ultimately impacts caregivers’ abilities to work and provide for their families, but also children’s development and their future capabilities. D.C.’s Environmental Threats Residential segregation in cities, typically by race or socioeconomic status, is a key player in driving environmental health inequities—and D.C. is one of the most racially segregated metropolitan areas in the U.S. The discrepancies are often concentrated by ward: residents of Wards 4, 5, and 6 (located in eastern and central D.C.) are disproportionately exposed to climate hazards such as chemicals in soil, air, and water. Meanwhile, Wards 7 and 8 have been found to face the highest climate burden.  Map of D.C. by Ward   ( What's My Ward? ) Some of the largest hazards include soil contamination, air pollution, and water pollution. Soil contamination is primarily caused by leaking underground storage tanks, those which have yet to be fixed—130 as of 2020—located mainly in Ward 5. Wards 5, 6, and 7 are home to the most active areas where development is hazardous due to previous contamination, known as brownfields. Air pollution in D.C. is driven primarily by exhaust from transportation, especially personal vehicles, contributing high levels of ground-level ozone. People living in metropolitan areas with high levels of segregation, like D.C., are more likely to be exposed to air pollutants, and the difference between white and minority populations exposed to multiple types of air pollution is more pronounced in these areas. For example, rates of lifetime prevalence of asthma are significantly higher among both children and adults in D.C. than national averages—but when broken down by race, the rate among Black children is 23% but only 6.5% among white children. Water pollution is also an issue, as numerous permit holders in the district are permitted to release waste into the water. However, southeast D.C. is exposed to higher levels of pollution because of its proximity to more combined sewer overflow pipes, which overflow with heavy rain and release harmful bacteria into water sources. The Anacostia River (which cuts through southeast D.C.) has higher levels of E. coli bacteria and turbidity, measuring below district standards, than the Potomac River (which runs along the western border). What’s being done—and what we can do D.C. is already making strides in improving its environmental impact, even with the challenges the Trump administration poses to such progress. DC Water’s Lead Free DC  campaign, which was launched in 2019, has been working to eliminate lead in the district’s drinking water with the lofty but necessary goal of replacing all lead service lines. As of August 2025, they are 23.1% of the way there, having already completed over 9,000 replacements. To reduce air pollution, the district’s Department of Energy and Environment launched the Carbon Free DC  campaign in 2023 — which aims to make D.C. carbon neutral by 2045 — meaning that the city won’t release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than it removes. Carbon Free DC outlines other sustainability goals as well, including improving housing, transportation, accessibility of needs for residents in environmentally friendly ways. The Trump administration, however, is making climate progress more difficult, even in the wake of increasingly destructive natural disasters across the country. A string of anti-climate actions—including withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, dismantling numerous climate regulations in favor of oil and fossil fuel industries, and even attempting to revoke the EPA’s finding that greenhouse gas emissions are harmful to people—suggest a scary future for the country in terms of climate change. However, there is also a need to address the clear social inequities that exist to help lessen the disproportionate impacts of the climate crisis, which the Trump administration is also threatening. It’s no coincidence that the areas most impacted by environmental racism and adverse climate hazards are also those that face other burdens, such as the highest poverty levels and lowest life expectancy. Despite this, the administration has cancelled hundreds of grants awarded through the EPA’s environmental and climate justice grant program, putting those most impacted by environmental hazards even more at risk. In a political environment so focused on defunding and deregulation, bolstering promotive factors among vulnerable communities and staying informed are imperative. Promotive factors help build resilience in children: for example, increasing green space in urban areas and encouraging children to spend more time outside can have many different positive impacts, like improved mental health. Promotive factors also include better health policy and easier access to adequate healthcare for minority populations, as they improve the lives of caregivers and therefore children. Education and awareness are also necessary: everyone who touches children’s lives, from parents to policymakers, has to be well-informed to stop perpetuating harmful habits and promote safer, healthier practices. Some organizations are already striving to do this. Nsedu Obot Witherspoon, the executive director of Children’s Environmental Health Network  (CEHN), has been leading the charge to advocate for children’s environmental health for over 20 years. Based in D.C., CEHN is a national organization with the broad mission of protecting all developing children from environmental health hazards through research, policy, education, and public awareness. CEHN leads many of its own initiatives, as well as collaborates with local and national partners and coalitions. Nsedu Obot Witherspoon (McCaw, 2020) One unique initiative it runs is the Eco-Healthy Child Care Program, which provides resources and training to child care professionals to create safer, hazard-free child care settings. “It’s the only program of its kind working to train and educate child care professionals, owners, and facility managers,” Witherspoon said. The program focuses on low-to-no-cost steps to remove environmental health hazards from these spaces, in which developing children spend significant amounts of time. It also offers a two-year endorsement for child care facilities who comply with the majority of CEHN’s child care-specific checklist, which monitors elements such as pesticides, air quality, household chemicals, lead, and others. Witherspoon noted, “Of course, we don’t shake fingers. We just say, here’s why. Here’s why we want to think differently about this.” She also explained that the program has multiple benefits, bringing knowledge and awareness to the professionals it teaches—who are often women, particularly women of color, of childbearing age. CEHN also focuses heavily on community education and awareness, producing an abundance of concise, fact-based guides and infographics that cover numerous aspects of child environmental health. They aim to make information accessible and digestible for parents, caregivers, professionals, and policymakers; materials are often only two to three pages in length and updated annually. For instance, CEHN closely tracks disease health outcomes, which include childhood cancer, asthma, lead poisoning, and water violations. “We have fact sheets for all 50 states, and one we’re developing for DC. It’s like an infographic: what is the issue, what are some major indicators of how children are doing, either well or not, compared to the rest of the country,” Witherspoon explained. “That’s one of the most common questions we get from elected officials: ‘How is our state doing, or how is our city doing?’ And we’re able to show them, with data sets that they can find—this isn’t just something that we arbitrarily came up with,” she added. “And again, we’re not there pointing fingers, but we’re just having an honest conversation.”  “Climate change is probably the most important children’s environmental health issue to date because it exacerbates everything else,” Witherspoon said, which holds particularly true for those disproportionately impacted by it. “The difference is, compared to when our organization started 33 years ago, we actually know a lot of the solutions. We see in a lot of cities and states, and around the world, better ways of doing things. And it takes political will, it takes courage, and it takes investments to make a lot of these things happen.” Ultimately, there is no doubt that environmental racism is detrimental to children’s development and is up against fierce governmental opposition—making individuals and organizations in D.C. even more responsible to do something about it. “How do we raise our voice, collectively, taking the resources that we have, taking the amazing intelligence of our upcoming generations?” Witherspoon asks. “That’s really where the crux of our resources want to go: we want you to be educated, we want you to elevate your thinking, we want to connect the dots for you, but more importantly, we want you to understand that there is something you can do about it.” To truly mitigate the effects of the climate crisis and build a more sustainable city, we need to make sure we do so for everyone —which means understanding and addressing the harmful inequities that already exist first.",,0,"en",2025-09-18T04:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""z4o9h472"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""The climate crisis is becoming an increasingly pressing global issue—and its adverse impacts aren’t affecting everyone equally.

From powering life-saving medical clinics to designing farms that grow crops under solar panels, his work blends creative design with practical solutions. In this interview, Sklar explains his vision for an ""elegant"" and accessible energy future for everyone. Introduction A building powered entirely by renewable energy, lights, appliances, and climate regulation systems running fully off-grid without fossil fuels might sound like a futuristic idea. For Professor Scott Sklar, it’s long been reality. His career began in the 1970s, a decade at the forefront of American energy policy and the rise of an environmental movement.  Scott Sklar has dedicated his career to advancing renewable energy innovation from his early advocacy work with renewable energy to his current roles as the Sustainable Energy Director of GWU's Environment & Energy Management Institute  and the Director of George Washington Solar Institute . Heightened environmental awareness during the 1970s in the United States sparked his passion for sustainability, he said, with the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act reshaping the nation’s priorities. His work includes numerous notable projects, ranging from solar panel installations in Singapore to solar panel-based farms in Washington, D.C. These groundbreaking projects make Sklar’s principles clear: energy should be elegant, efficient, and accessible. Today, he continues to inspire the next generation of sustainable innovators while actively promoting the integration of efficient energy, renewable sources, and creative design within his teaching.  Early Days and Motivations Between the 1970s and early 80s, the United States saw a rise in environmental awareness and activism while facing multiple major energy crises. In both 1973 and 1979, geopolitical instability in the Middle East led to disruptions in Arab and Iranian oil exports. While working as a legislative aide to New York Senator Jacob K. Javits, Sklar recalled that he, along with most members of Congress at the time, lacked knowledge of the energy industry. Although Sklar acknowledged the challenge of tapping into the country’s renewable resource opportunities without access to modern technology, he was motivated by the obvious need for renewable energy, he said.   “No one’s going to interfere with your sunlight, your wind, your water, your heat... It was an inexhaustible supply,” Sklar said. “It couldn’t be controlled by anyone.” For Sklar, this independence was a driving force. He realized that traditional energy industries, such as oil and gas, didn’t want to see these new technologies developed as they sought to keep their monopoly over the energy market. This pushback was just another motivator for Sklar to pursue renewable energy, develop clean power, and expand awareness. The Potential of Energy Efficiency Energy efficiency isn’t just a technical approach but one that lays the groundwork for sustainable design, aesthetics, and innovation. However, before innovation can take place, Sklar emphasizes the importance of reassessing the energy we currently consume to prioritize efficiency and accessibility.  “I don’t want us to go 100% solar, I want us to go 100% maximum energy efficiency,” Sklar said. “It’s always less expensive to save energy than generate it from any source.”  In 1995, Sklar founded  The Stella Group, Ltd,  now a global business with the goal of  “elegant integration,” which encapsulates the blending of energy efficiency, all renewable energy sources, and various forms of energy storage. Now, as a professor at the George Washington University's Sustainable Urban Planning Master of Professional Studies and Graduate School of Professional Studies, he teaches this philosophy in his courses, such as “Energy Resources”  and “Renewable Energy & Critical Infrastructure.”   When asked specifically about solar power, Sklar explained that solar panels stand out among other forms of clean energy as they have no moving parts at all; they are elegant, still, and unique.  “Even in the desert we grow food,” he explained. “There is sunlight everywhere.”  It is ubiquitous in our society and presents itself as a static technology, as Sklar depicted. Solar panels can be integrated almost anywhere, from rooftops and roadways to parking lots and bus stop awnings, demonstrating their flexibility and potential for new design. This constant opportunity for innovation is why Sklar continues to fuel his passion for sustainability by continuing to teach and research the field.  Creative Side of Renewable Energy + Benefits 
 The integration of creativity, aesthetics, and renewable energy is transforming modern architecture. Sklar’s work in Singapore — where he integrated printed solar panels  into building facades to capture a more creative look — highlights this trend. A captivating factor, he added, was the ability to integrate renewable energy into the building form. It isn’t just an opportunity to manipulate photovoltaics but also solar daylighting, the use of windows or skylights to introduce natural light in place of artificial lighting. In his home office, a solar daylighting “bubble” provides full-spectrum light that dramatically changes interior spaces. The possibilities are endless, though, with possibilities ranging from giant domes to pentagons, he said.  Not only does solar daylighting provide the chance to improve aesthetics, but it also has measurable mental and physical benefits. Research shows that full-spectrum light can boost productivity, reduce sickness for students and workers, and even increase retail sales. Notably, in Japan, solar-heated water is promoted for its skin health benefits, reducing allergies, and improving overall well-being. Furthermore, the EU-funded  TilePlus project, developed  with support from German climate tech firm Autarq and involving participants in Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden, highlights how European architects are leading sustainable design. The project’s solar roofing shingles seamlessly replace traditional ones, offering both protection and efficiency as they generate electricity.  Transforming Access to Energy: Sklar is passionate about more than just technology — he is driven by the human impact of renewable energy products. As a long-time advocate for sustainability, Sklar emphasizes the importance of inspiring the next generation of clean energy innovators, he said.  For example, lightweight, inflatable solar lights, designed by two South African students who later met with Professor Sklar in Washington, D.C., provide critical power to off-grid communities, revolutionizing how people access energy. These low-cost devices, which charge in sunlight for just an hour and provide several hours of illumination, have brought critical power to off-grid communities. Further, these devices reduce the need for kerosene, a game-changing improvement in limiting the need for crude oil products. Sklar highlights how we take light for granted in industrialized areas and how these innovations can transform lives in remote regions. “We have over 8 billion people on this planet, a third of them have no electricity,” Sklar said.  Beyond casting light, this progress opens doors to applications like solar water pumping and clean cooking, showcasing how even ideas that start small can have profound impacts on people’s lives.  Medical Resilience:  Sklar’s work also extends into the public health sector, where energy access can make the difference between life and death. During an Ebola crisis in Africa, Sklar met with World Health Organization (WHO) representatives after presentations he gave to four African embassies in Washington, D.C., to address critical energy gaps in rural clinics. A lack of reliable power resulted in life-threatening challenges, he said, including surgeries performed under candlelight, spoiled vaccines in powerless refrigerators, and improperly disinfected medical equipment.  To address these shortages, Sklar collaborated with representatives from the WHO and the United Nations to advocate for solar and wind clinics. By understanding the needs of the medical providers and assessing the right technologies, his team helped deploy sustainable power systems such as solar and wind-powered clinics in affected areas during a real-time crisis, offering a blueprint for medical resilience in the future. Agrivoltaics and Clean Farming In partnership with Professor John Forrer at GWU, Sklar became involved in a Department of Energy (DOE) funded project on agrivoltaics, alongside the National New Bilingual Laboratory and the National Center for Appropriate Technology. This project aimed to address pushback against solar energy in rural areas, as solar installations often covered ground that would be used for farming or livestock.  Agrivoltaic farming, however, offered a solution, as it involves raising solar panels high enough for tractors and farmers to pass beneath them while simultaneously providing shade for crops to grow. Professor Scott Sklar in the field at the largest agrivoltaics project in Washington, D.C April 2023 This system was installed at the convent on the Catholic University campus, which doubles as a community garden, and now bears the title of the largest solar installation within the city borders of Washington, D.C. The convent now serves as a model for urban clean energy, demonstrating how innovative design can redefine the relationship between agriculture and renewable energy generation.  Conclusion - Inspiration for The Next Gen of Innovators  Professor Sklar’s work continues to inspire the next generation of clean energy innovators. Through his teaching, collaboration with students, and global partnerships, he encourages young leaders to think creatively and challenge conventional approaches.  The Catalyst looks forward to hosting Professor Sklar on an upcoming podcast, where he will delve deeper into the groundbreaking projects that inspire and energize him.  References Daylight Specialists.

From the early days of robotic assistance in minimally invasive surgery to today’s systems that can recognize anatomy, adapt as tissue shifts, and plan intricate movements with remarkable precision, the field is evolving at an extraordinary pace. At the center is a team of engineers and clinicians rethinking how human skill and machine intelligence can operate in synergy, transforming what surgery renders possible. From Sci-Fi to Supervised Autonomy From the development of robots in the early 20th century to the robotic boom of the 1980s, the idea of surgical robots belonged to the realm of science fiction. Yet by 1985, the first steps toward commercialization had begun. Surgeons adapted the PUMA 560, an industrial robotic arm originally designed for factory automation, to guide a needle during CT-guided brain biopsies. In that first successful use, the robot performed a delicate brain tissue sampling with unprecedented steadiness, demonstrating that machines could deliver precision beyond the limits of the human hand.  By the early 2000s, robotic platforms such as Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci®  had entered operating rooms worldwide. Their rise coincided with growing demand for less invasive technologies, hospital competition for technological prestige, and surgeon interest in tools that could reduce fatigue and improve precision. This convergence of clinical, commercial, and technological incentives fueled the rapid adoption of surgical robotics across the U.S. and abroad. Cleared by the FDA  in 2000 for general laparoscopic procedures - operations performed through small incisions using slender instruments and a camera - da Vinci  transformed possibilities for minimally invasive surgery. The robot’s articulated instruments restored the dexterity lost in traditional laparoscopic tools by mimicking the rotation of a human wrist, while its stereoscopic camera provided a magnified, three-dimensional view of the operative field. Together, these features gave surgeons unprecedented precision in confined anatomical spaces.  Yet for all its advances, da Vinci remains entirely tele-operated: a sophisticated extension of the surgeon's hand. It faithfully executes every console command but lacks the capacity to make independent decisions. Overcoming these limitations defines the next frontier: autonomy.  The IMERSE Lab and the Next Frontier At Johns Hopkins University, the Intelligent Medical Robotic Systems and Equipment ( IMERSE ) Lab, led by Dr. Axel Krieger, is bringing robotic autonomy into the operating room. The team is developing robotic systems that interpret complex anatomical environments, plan and adapt their actions as conditions evolve, and move beyond pre-scripted motions toward intelligent, collaborative assistance.  Achieving true autonomy demands close collaboration between engineers, computer scientists, and surgeons. The IMERSE Lab’s work bridges these disciplines, translating advances in machine learning and computer vision into practical surgical systems capable of navigating the variability and unpredictability of living anatomy with reliability, subtleties that still elude even the most advanced simulations.  Importantly, the IMERSE Lab's goal is not to replace surgeons but to amplify their judgment, reduce both the physical and cognitive demands of surgery, and ensure greater consistency in outcomes.  STAR: A First Proof of Concept Autonomous surgery first drew wide scientific attention through a series of collaborative efforts led by Dr. Axel Krieger and his colleagues at Children's National Hospital, and later continued at Johns Hopkins University. In 2016, Krieger’s team demonstrated an early open-surgery version of the Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR)  - performed through a traditional incision rather than small laparoscopic openings - which successfully carried out autonomous soft-tissue suturing  in vivo (in living tissue)  on animal models.  Six years later, the refined STAR took on a new mission: laparoscopic intestinal anastomosis - reconnecting two ends of the intestine after removing a diseased segment. This delicate task requires extreme precision, where even minute errors in suture spacing or tension can lead to leakage and serious complications.  Operating laparoscopically intensifies the technical challenge. Surgeons must operate through small incisions using long instruments and a camera, working without direct tactile feedback and within narrow visual and mechanical constraints. Achieving the precision required for secure, tension-free suturing under these conditions challenges even the most experienced hands.   The greatest obstacle, however, lies in the living tissue itself: soft organs bend, stretch, and shift with every breath, demanding sub-millimeter accuracy . To manage this, STAR  integrated several innovations: an advanced three-dimensional endoscope to reconstruct the surgical field, near-infrared fluorescent markers to track tissue motion in real time, and machine learning algorithms capable of mapping optimal stitch placement and replanning whenever tissue displacement exceeded roughly three millimeters. In 2022, STAR  successfully performed autonomous intestinal anastomosis in live pigs without human guidance. Evaluations showed that its sutures matched, and in some trials exceeded, those of experienced surgeons in spacing consistency and tissue alignment. The demonstration marked the first laparoscopic autonomous soft-tissue surgery in vivo , building upon the earlier open-surgery version completed in 2016. The Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) system, developed by the IMERSE Lab at Johns Hopkins University. ( The IMERSE LAB  / Johns Hopkins University ) Despite its success, STAR remained limited in scope: it was purpose-built for a single procedure and required nearly a decade of iterative development to reach that milestone. The next challenge was to design systems capable of generalizing across operations and adapting flexibly to new surgical contexts with the same level of precision.  The Rise of SRT-H That challenge - to create systems capable of generalizing across operations and learning to perform different surgical procedures - became the foundation for the next stage of research at the IMERSE Lab. Within the group, Juo-Tung “Justin” Chen, a doctoral researcher in mechanical engineering, helped develop the Surgical Robot Transformer-H ( SRT-H ) , a system designed to teach robots surgical workflows through human demonstration rather than manually programming each motion. PhD student Juo-Tung “Justin” Chen beside the SRT-H robotic system (Juo-Tung Chen / Johns Hopkins University) At its core, SRT-H uses a hierarchical decision-making structure. A high-level planner issues task-level directives in plain language, such as “expose Calot’s triangle, ” an anatomical landmark near the gallbladder’s ducts, or  “apply clip to duct.”  Low-level controllers then translate those commands into precise movements of robotic arms and tools using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms that map each instruction to corresponding motor actions. The separation mirrors how people operate: first reasoning through what must be done, then executing it physically.  Before each motion is executed, the system displays the planner’s directive on a surgeon-facing console interface, allowing the operator to review and confirm what the robot intends to do. This visibility provides transparency and allows the supervising surgeons to intervene before the action occurs. This design makes SRT-H both interpretable and resilient. Surgeons can observe the planner’s language-based instructions and understand what the robot intends to do, offering a degree of transparency uncommon in machine-learning systems. When unexpected situations arise, such as tissue dyed red to simulate bleeding, or an organ shifted into a different orientation, SRT-H relies on stereo cameras and real-time vision sensors that continuously track the operative field. When these sensors detect a deviation beyond a set tolerance, the high-level planner automatically replans the next movement or issues a corrective micro-adjustment, such as “shift gripper slightly right,” allowing the workflow to continue rather than freezing mid-procedure. SRT-H has already advanced toward the operating room. In published studies, it  achieved step-level autonomy - that is, independence across a sequence of surgical steps rather than a single repeated motion - during the clipping and cutting phase of a cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) on ex vivo (outside-the-body) pig tissue. Across eight trials, the robot completed the sequence without human intervention, achieving 100 percent success. While not yet capable of a full cholecystectomy, this demonstration marked the first time a system achieved autonomous control across multiple surgical subtasks rather than a single isolated skill.   SRT-H led cholecystectomy on a pig gallbladder, 14x speed ( Juo-Tung Chen / Johns Hopkins Universit y) What Makes SRT-H Different Earlier autonomous prototypes like STAR proved that surgical autonomy was possible but remained limited in flexibility and scope. SRT-H takes a fundamentally different approach, both in how it learns and how it adapts.  Data-Driven Training Instead of relying on hand-coded rules, the team trained SRT-H on roughly 18,000 surgical demonstrations collected from over 30 pig gallbladders. Operators performed gallbladder dissections using the da Vinci robotic system, recording synchronized video and instrument motion. Clinical collaborators oversaw the process to replicate real surgical conditions, ensuring the data captured reflected the precision and rhythm of a true operating room.  Language-Conditioned Learning Each demonstration was annotated with one of 17 subtask phrases, such as “grasp gallbladder”  or “apply first clip.”  By linking actions to language, the robot learns to reason in ways that humans can easily interpret, and, more importantly, correct through feedback expressed in plain terms. This language-conditioned structure not only makes its decisions transparent but also bridges human and machine communication inside the operating room. Robustness to Variation To prevent overfitting - when an algorithm performs well on familiar data but fails in new environments, the researchers deliberately perturbed the training data. They altered colors, simulated bleeding, cropped images, and randomized orientations to expose the robot to countless variations. As a result, SRT-H can operate reliably even when confronted with occlusion, distortion, or unexpected visual cues, demonstrating a level of adaptability that earlier systems lacked. Real-Time Recovery  Whereas STAR paused when conditions changed, SRT-H adapts in real time. It can issue micro-adjustments, such as “move gripper slightly right,”  and continue seamlessly through a task. This capacity for real-time correction makes it a far more practical candidate for clinical transition. Scaling the Vision For Chen and his colleagues, the gallbladder experiments mark only the first step toward a broader goal: expanding surgical autonomy through shared, data-driven learning. If SRT-H demonstrated that autonomy can extend beyond a single task, the next frontier is scaling that capability across procedures, robots, and institutions.  To achieve this, the IMERSE Lab and its collaborators, including NVIDIA, aim to develop foundation models for surgical robotics. Much like large language models trained on vast collections of text, these systems would learn from multimodal surgical data encompassing videos, robotic motion, imaging, and annotations gathered from diverse clinical environments. By training across such varied datasets, a foundation model could, in principle, generalize surgical knowledge across tasks and platforms, adapting flexibly to new operating conditions.  The long-term ambition is the creation of a shared foundation model capable of enabling robotic systems to perform a wide range of procedures, even in settings without subspecialist expertise. In this vision, surgical autonomy is not a luxury technology reserved for advanced centers but a tool for equitable access, bringing expert-level surgical care to every hospital, anywhere in the world.  Ethical Considerations and the Future Role of the Surgeon The promise of surgical autonomy brings with it a new set of challenges. Robotic systems may offer surgeons greater precision, consistency, and reduced fatigue, but surgery remains a field where even minor errors can have life-altering consequences - and where public trust, once lost, is difficult to regain.  Chen emphasizes that autonomy in surgery does not mean independence. He envisions a future in which the surgeon becomes a supervisor and decision-maker, guiding the operation while the robot executes repetitive or technically demanding tasks. He likens this to autonomous driving: a car may steer, brake, and park itself, but a human driver still bears responsibility. Likewise, surgical robots are being designed as collaborators - extensions of the surgeon’s skill, not replacements for their judgment. Realizing this future will require far more than advances in algorithms. Engineers and clinicians will need clear regulatory standards, robust safety mechanisms, and transparent validation frameworks to ensure reliability. Just as importantly, they must cultivate patient trust through openness and ethical design, ensuring that progress in autonomy enhances, not undermines, the human connection at the heart of medicine. Conclusion The trajectory of the IMERSE Lab’s work, from STAR’s meticulously engineered sutures to SRT-H’s language-guided learning, captures both the promise and the complexity of surgical autonomy. What once seemed speculative is now unfolding through trial, error, and iteration in real laboratories, where autonomy is being redefined not as independence, but as collaboration.  For now, the surgeon’s hands remain indispensable. Through the work of researchers like Justin Chen, the operating room is steadily evolving into a space of collaboration between human judgment and machine intelligence. The future of surgery may not hinge on choosing between surgeon or robot, but on discovering new ways for the two to think and operate as one.",,0,"en",2025-11-03T15:45:58Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""w8wtr403"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Inside Johns Hopkins University’s IMERSE Lab, surgical robotics is entering a new frontier.

Dr. Brent Harris is a physician-scientist whose work in neuropathology, brain sampling, and ALS has helped millions of Americans. His reach extends beyond traditional clinical care; his development of Brain Banks and promotion of legislation for ALS research has allowed Harris to leave a lasting mark on neurodegenerative disease research. It is pivotal to understand how Harris’ proximity to the nation’s capital has facilitated his ultimate goal as a Physician: to improve the lives of patients.     Who is Dr. Brent Harris? Dr. Brent Harris is a Professor of Neuropathology at Georgetown University, and an Adjunct Associate Professor at both George Washington University and Howard University, whose current work focuses on neurodegeneration and the underlying influence of glial-neuronal relationships in the development of neurological diseases. From an early age, Harris loved both science and medicine and decided to pursue both, he said. As a physician-scientist, Dr. Harris’s work ranges from brain tissue lab research to extensive patient care. After completing his MD/PhD at Georgetown University, Harris conducted his Residency Pathology at Stanford University Medical School. Harris returned to his alma mater in 2010, this time as a Georgetown Medical School professor. He has since established the Georgetown Brain Bank and POND Bank, in addition to assuming the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for DC. Here he has been utilizing his proximity to the capital to initiate and lead many programs to advance the treatment and research for neuroinflammatory diseases including working with National organizations such as NIH.  
 Why His Work Matters Above all, Dr. Harris epitomizes every physician's vocational heart and every scientist's curious mind, combining both professions to help investigate the most difficult questions about brain disease. Learning about how Dr. Harris has maintained a profound impact in both clinical and translational research settings can inspire future students to pursue careers that emphasize the importance of making an impact that will be felt across the intricate fields of biomedical sciences. Lastly, Dr. Harris’ commitment to service in battling brain disease nationwide, demonstrates the significance of working in Medicine in the capital of the United States.  The MD/PhD Journey Before we can begin to understand Dr. Harris, we must first understand how he arrived at his current position. What is an MD/PhD? Why an MD/PhD? And what is a Neuropathologist? And funnily enough, Dr. Harris was once sitting in your exact seats asking the exact same questions.  Like many, Dr. Harris was a fan of science and medicine but was confused as to where these loves would lead him. In undergraduate, he pursued a Liberal Arts degree and balanced this with courses in the natural sciences. Before long, he found himself in a Summer program at the National Institutes of Health and decided he was going to pursue a career in the biomedical sciences. Once he completed a Master's in Biochemistry, he decided he finally was ready to apply to Medical School and devote his career in Medicine.  However, he did not want to leave science behind. Thus, he applied to pursue an MD/PhD. The MD/PhD is a combined program offered at many Medical Schools in order to train a unique group of Physician-Scientists, Doctors who can interface between the worlds of clinical and basic research, offering a wide expertise across a range of disciplines. Dr. Harris applied to Georgetown Medical School and pursued an MD/PhD in Neuroscience, citing the Brain as the “Final Frontier” in Medicine.    Faced with the decision of residency, Dr. Harris could choose Neurology, the study of diagnosing and managing disorders of the nervous system; Psychiatry, focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions; Neurosurgery, involving surgical interventions to treat diseases of the brain and spinal cord; or Neuropathology, the microscopic study of nervous system tissues to understand disease at the cellular level. Ultimately he found Neuropathology to be the most complimentary for understanding the core mechanisms of the brain’s functions as well as an avenue for critical support in all aspects of medicine.  “You kind of break down neuropathology into the clinical aspects, the teaching aspects and the research aspects,” Harris said. “I chose neuropathology because I enjoy doing all three of those things.” After making this leap into the unknown, Dr. Harris continued his career with stints in Residency at Stanford Medical Center and working at Dartmouth University. Only after this period, did Dr Harris finally return to DC, once again working in his Alma Mater of Georgetown University.  “I choose the last unknown frontier in medicine, the neurosciences when deciding where I wanted to spend the next 40-50 years” Building Bridges with Brain Banks After arriving in Washington DC, Dr. Harris began to understand the real nature of his responsibility as a physician-scientist. With training in both basic research and clinical care, Dr. Harris serves as a unique thoroughfare between the worlds of science and medicine. Naturally, Dr. Harris began to become involved in a myriad of programs and initiatives that he could lend his specific blend of expertise.  Enter Brain Banks, a physical database to host specimens of brain tissue used for basic research. He describes them as “banks” in the truest sense, where clinical data, tissue, and fluids are carefully collected, classified, and stored for future research. This process allows researchers to study diseases like ALS at an unprecedented depth, leveraging tools like genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics —“Any omics you can think of,” as Dr. Harris describes.  These advanced approaches, combined with the use of patient tissue, are unlocking critical insights into disease mechanisms, particularly neuroinflammation and the interplay between glial and neuronal cells that drive ALS progression. Oftentimes researchers can discern the presence of hereditary diseases through the proper use of brain banks when connected to deceased family members. Here Dr. Harris can merge his two expertise, as he can clinically consent and work with the patients and then utilize his background in pathology to collect and understand tissue samples.  However, the ability to host and store these tissues is quite difficult, considering the IRB approval necessary to collect the tissues and the economic upkeep of the physical space of these sensitive gigabytes of information. Here, Dr. Harris sets himself apart due to his unwavering commitment to the public good and the use of his resources. Through Georgetown’s prominence in the U.S. capital, Dr. Harris has been able to continually fight for grants to upkeep the Georgetown Brain Bank and simultaneously start new initiatives across the United States. With developments in Machine Learning and improving the speed of analysis and the accuracy of reports, each brain tissue is becoming increasingly more valuable in the information they can provide. Therefore, Dr. Harris and his team’s work is not only actively supporting patients directly, but indirectly leading to discoveries in labs across the nation. Dr Harris recognizes that a paper can only do so much and through providing tissue samples to other researchers, he exponentially advances the research for neurodegenerative diseases one brain at a time. Targeting ALS: From Lab Work to Legislative Action Dr. Harris’s work extends beyond the lab and brain bank, reflecting his unwavering commitment to understanding and combating devastating neurological diseases. Currently Dr. Harris finds his most far-reaching work through the legislative initiatives started by governmental organizations. As part of the ALL ALS initiative, Dr. Harris played a pivotal role in passing legislation to bolster funding and accessibility for brain banks and research sites across the United States. This initiative represents a monumental leap in uniting clinical and translational research, enabling 35 sites nationwide to collect brain tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. These resources are critical for identifying early biomarkers and therapeutic targets, with the ultimate goal of transforming ALS from a fatal disease into a treatable condition. The ALL ALS initiative exemplifies the power of ""team science,"" where neurologists, molecular biologists, and bioengineers collaborate to address one of neuroscience’s most pressing challenges. Dr. Harris underscores that this collaborative approach allows for the integration of diverse expertise, which is essential to tackling the complex mechanisms underlying ALS. Dr. Harris’s dedication to advancing ALS research is also evident in his leadership of the Target ALS program. This initiative was created to address a significant gap in ALS research: the availability of high-quality tissues and biofluids for scientific study. As a neuropathologist and Director of the Georgetown Brain Bank, Dr. Harris has championed the importance of brain banks as foundational tools in research. For Dr. Harris, neuropathology is more than a field—it is a vocation that bridges science and medicine. His work highlights the critical role of neuropathologists as collaborators and stewards of human tissue, advancing both research and patient care. As he explains, neuropathologists are uniquely positioned to teach others about the human aspect of diseases and their pathological underpinnings. By enabling researchers to access high-quality, anonymized samples, Dr. Harris’s brain bank supports scientific discovery and honors the profound generosity of donors and their families. This ethos extends to his research, where he uses advanced molecular biology and cutting-edge tools like machine learning to explore how glial cells contribute to disease. Dr. Harris’s work is a testament to the transformative potential of neuropathology, uniting clinical insight and scientific inquiry to combat ALS and other neurological diseases. Key Highlights and Takeaways  Dr. Harris’ path and experience represent a crucial identity that all aspiring scientists should have - your work is a vocation. The centrality of this premise is represented through the extremely diverse body of work that Dr. Harris has accumulated throughout his long career. Through legislative initiatives, symposiums and basic research the scope of his efforts to help patients through their neurodegenerative diseases is immense.  In addition, being a leading physician and investigator in Washington, D.C. has allowed Dr. Harris to promote his research on a national and international level. As Harris said, “There is no place I would rather be” when I asked why he continued to pursue his research and work in the Capital of the United States. Dr Harris reminds all of us that our unique interests can be melded together and in fact beneficial to our careers.

As a species, humanity has only begun to peel back the film covering the mysteries of evolution; ecological surveillance allows for the understanding of the interplay between an organism and its environment, elucidating why certain traits are selected for in nature. However, the genetic   origins   of such selected traits are often unknown—leaving many scientists fascinated on how changes in the genome give rise to evolutionary novelty. 
 To explore these unknowns, Dr. Luca Livraghi  studies the colorful and diverse patterns on the wings of butterflies. These evolutionary canvases boast strong visual evidence of selection, making butterflies an effective system for studying how changes in the genome lead to ecological adaptation. This work in particular encapsulates multiple sub-fields of biology, stitching together population genetics—which heavily relies on statistical analyses to pinpoint regions of DNA that show high levels of variability within a given population—and evolutionary developmental genetics, which attempts to make sense of evolutionary change by uncovering the genetic mechanisms responsible for producing novel traits in a species. Dr. Livraghi, who is trained as an evolutionary biologist, currently works at George Washington University as a Postdoctoral Researcher to understand these mechanisms, peering into the world of silvered wing patterns in Speyeria mormonia  butterflies.

""The butterfly system itself is an incredible way to measure diversity; on a phenotypic level, you have scorable natural variation within populations that is very easy to get at experimentally. Because butterflies are so variable, you can easily track phenotypically associated genetic variants and see how they change over space and time."" A characteristic analysis often utilized in this field is the Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). Through inputting the genetic information of groups of individuals displaying a wide range of phenotypes, the GWAS searches through the entire population’s genome, giving information on small differences, or polymorphisms, in DNA sequence between each subject. A successful GWA experiment can accurately identify a single location across DNA samples with high levels of polymorphism—meaning there are unmatching nucleotides between individuals with different phenotypes at that specific location. This data can be used to conclude that, for example, a fish with red scales has a mutation in a certain area while a fish with blue scales doesn’t, explaining their differences in morphology. For Dr. Livraghi, conducting a GWAS was just the beginning of a series of comprehensive experiments to further confirm the involvement of the gene opti x   in the repression of silver colored scales in the wings of Speyeria mormonia, a North American orange and silver butterfly. Previously identified as a master regulator of eye development in Drosophila  fruit flies, optix  has been found to take on a different role in the wings of butterflies, acting as a genetic light switch for coloration and patterning (1). This epitomizes the central pillar of evolutionary development, showing how the genetic regions surrounding certain genes can become   hotspots   of evolutionary diversity, as slight changes in gene expression opens up an abundance of potential pathways for further evolution to tread upon.  To examine closer, Dr. Livraghi performed a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) experiment to target and fluorescently tag optix  mRNA transcripts, visualizing their location within the tissue through a microscope. Fluorescent stainings are able to determine how and when a gene may perform its function. Results found that at ~50% pupal development, optix  is absent in presumptive silvered spots on the wings, indicating it may work to repress the silver scale state.  “The way that optix has picked up this role in butterflies is unclear. We’re not sure what the ancestral role of this gene was, but even though it acts as a regulator of eye development in Drosophila, it doesn’t mean it was necessarily ‘co-opted’ [re-used] towards a pattern regulation gene in butterflies. In CRISPR knock-out individuals, we don’t see any effects in the eye, so the hypothesis is shaky—optix is definitely pleiotropic, it’s unclear and unlikely that it’s been co-opted from an eye development role.” Dr. Livraghi worked to confirm these findings through utilization of RNA interference (RNAi) gene ‘knockdown’, which gives insight into an organism’s phenotype if it didn’t   have  a certain gene during crucial periods in its development. Through the introduction of a silencing RNA species into the cells of the developing pupal wing, researchers are able to target and break down RNA transcripts of a gene of interest. In this case, the knockdowns targeted the optix  gene, and the resulting mutants yielded fascinating results—covering the wings with patches of silver. This data all but confirms that optix  functions to suppress   silvered spots; its regulation during development, amazingly, has been controlled tightly by evolution, restricting it from specific areas on the wing but allowing free reign everywhere else. The precise control of pigment genes is crucial for adaptive evolution of all butterfly species, allowing for a wide range of diversity among populations.  Developing and using the genetic tools we have at our disposal is crucial to examining the world around us, allowing for the gradual climb of our species towards greater understanding—unraveling the complex knots that biology has tied itself since the dawn of cellular life. Mechanistic explanations for evolutionary processes act as a flame to ignite these knots and fuel our progress, providing the basis for millions of years of evolutionary diversity. ""If you want to understand evolutionary principles, you have to understand the underlying genetic drivers of diversity—to understand how phenotypes evolved, first you must understand how genes evolved to generate these phenotypes. To understand the general evolutionary principle, you need to understand genetics. There’s another side to the quote ‘nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution’. In reality, nothing makes sense except in the light of development, it’s necessary to pull back the folds of such evolutionary questions.""

However, as he advanced in his collegiate studies, he found himself captivated by something else entirely. In the 1970s, molecular biology captured his attention through its cutting-edge transformation of the field of biological research with breakthroughs in gene cloning and recombinant DNA. However, as a senior, Dr. Hawdon had already declared an animal science degree.  With little time to spare, he decided to get creative and reached out to a research lab, only to learn that a prerequisite course stood in his way. Not one to shy away from a challenge, Dr. Hawdon completed the requirement and secured a position in the lab, hoping to gain hands-on experience to strengthen his graduate school applications for molecular biology. But life, like science, doesn’t always go as planned, and his applications were met with rejection. Forced to pivot, Dr. Hawdon took a teaching job at a proprietary technical school—not an obvious stepping stone into research, but it paid the bills. His schedule was relentless, teaching five courses a day, five days a week, but in the midst of that relentless schedule, fate quietly intervened. One of the courses he taught was parasitology, and those parasites were … interesting. For Dr. Hawdon, these organisms pointed to a field rich with questions waiting to be answered. In the meantime, after two years of persistent effort in pursuit of research, Dr. Hawdon landed a position at the University of Pittsburgh, where he worked with C. elegans , a microscopic nematode, or roundworm making waves in biological research. Through this research, Dr. Hawdon realized his true interests lay in worms with direct consequences for human health, and just like that, his passion for parasitology clicked into focus. With a renewed sense of determination, Dr. Hawdon pursued graduate studies in parasitology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he met Peter Hotez, a rising figure in vaccine development for parasitic diseases. Their collaboration led Dr. Hawdon to a postdoctoral position at Yale University’s MacArthur Center for Molecular Parasitology, and soon after, he became an Associate Research Scientist in the Medical Helminthology Laboratory in the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at Yale. Nine years later, he joined George Washington University, where he would carve out his own niche in the field.  With the support of his first independent grant, he pivoted from vaccine research and leaned into the molecular mechanisms of parasitic worms and their impact on human health. Over time, his work has helped shape the field of parasitology, inspiring a new generation of scientists. Reflecting on this, Dr. Hawdon calls it “a piece of big luck,” but more than luck, it was his persistence, adaptability, and readiness to follow wherever science led him. When asked what piece of advice has guided his career, Dr. Hawdon shared his personal take on Louis Pasteur’s famous words:  ""Serendipity favors the prepared mind.""  Looking at his journey, it’s hard to disagree. Tackling a Growing Threat: Anthelmintic Resistance Today, Dr. Hawdon’s research focuses on tackling one of parasitology’s most pressing challenges: anthelmintic resistance. Anthelmintics, or anti-parasitic drugs, have historically been highly effective in treating helminthiasis—infections caused by helminths or parasitic worms—eliminating about 99%  of susceptible helminths. However, misuse of anthelmintic drugs in agriculture and human medicine has fueled the emergence of drug-resistant strains, posing a serious threat to both human and animal health. The consequences are especially dire within the livestock industry. Sheep farmers, for example, have long heavily relied on deworming treatments to prevent helminthiasis in their livestock. However, in some regions, the misuse of anthelmintics has spurred the evolution of resistant nematodes, devastating  sheep farms worldwide. This raises concerns that, without alternative strategies to control resistance, conventional livestock farming could become unsustainable. Dr. Hawdon’s lab is at the forefront of understanding the genetic mechanics driving resistance. In a 2024 publication , his team characterized a naturally occurring strain of Ancylostoma caninum , a canine hookworm, resistant to three major classes of anthelmintics and identified genetic mutations associated with the resistance. The lab also observed altered larval activation responses in the resistant strains, suggesting changes in the signaling pathways involved in the activation process. These findings may inform future strategies for managing drug-resistant hookworm populations. Ancylostoma caninum  (photo by Andrea Langeland ) Dr. Hawdon also notes the potential emergence of resistance in human medicine. While current treatments for helminthiasis are largely effective, early warning signs suggest that resistance may already be developing as some deworming programs have reported worrying declines in efficacy against human hookworm infections. Although this is not yet cause for alarm, these findings underscore the need for proactive solutions. Serendipity Strikes Again: The Greyhound Hookworm Mystery In 2014, a veterinarian informed Dr. Hawdon about a puzzling case: a retired greyhound with a persistent hookworm infection that no treatment could eliminate. Intrigued, he obtained a stool sample and began investigating. What he found was alarming—the hookworms were resistant to all three major drugs used to treat helminthiasis in dogs. This wasn’t a fluke (literally—flukes are parasitic flatworms, but these were nematodes … 😉). Racing greyhounds, much like farmed sheep, undergo frequent deworming, which over time inadvertently selects for highly resistant worms. As the racing industry declined, many retired greyhounds were adopted into households, unknowingly bringing their “superworms” with them.  Building upon the discovery of multidrug-resistant hookworms in retired greyhounds, Dr. Hawdon's lab is diving deeper into the genetic basis of this resistance. Their research aims to develop better diagnostic tools and treatment strategies to combat these ""superworms."" By understanding the specific genetic mutations and altered biological pathways in these resistant hookworm populations, the lab hopes to discover more effective control measures and mitigate the spread of resistance. A Folk Remedy with Modern Potential: The Bitter Melon Discovery Another unexpected breakthrough in Dr. Hawdon's research came from a master’s student with a passion for ethnobotany, the study of traditional plant-based medicines. While conducting fieldwork in Haiti, she met a voodoo priest who shared knowledge of traditional medicinal plants used for deworming. Curious, she returned with five plant samples for lab testing, and while all showed some level of activity, one stood out: bitter melon. Intrigued, Dr. Hawdon began growing bitter melon himself, harvesting and processing the plants in his own backyard to further investigate its curative properties. His lab has since uncovered that compounds within the plant disrupt feeding in specific developmental stages of hookworms and is currently working to identify the active components responsible for this effect and understand their mechanisms of action—research which may uncover novel plant-based alternatives for helminthiasis treatments. The Power of Curiosity and Persistence Dr. Hawdon’s journey is a testament to the idea that science rewards those who follow their curiosity, even if it means navigating unpredictable paths along the way. His story demonstrates that great discoveries don't always come from carefully laid plans; sometimes they emerge from a pile of rejection letters, an exhausting job, or an unexpected conversation with a veterinarian friend. The key lies in recognizing opportunities where others see obstacles, and finding value in the unexpected.  After all, as Dr. Hawdon has learned firsthand, serendipity truly does favor the prepared mind.

Ullman's Declarative/Procedural (DP) model posits language relies on two core brain memory systems. Developed at MIT, his widely cited theory links our mental lexicon (words) to declarative memory (facts/events) and mental grammar (rules) to procedural memory (skills). This framework, derived from studying neurological patients, offers key insights into language processing, disorders, and learning. Architect of the Declarative/Procedural Model Michael T. Ullman, Ph.D.,  is a professor in the Department of Neuroscience at Georgetown University and director of the Brain and Language Lab, which researches the neurocognitive bases of language and memory. While earning his doctorate in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the early 1990s, Dr. Ullman proposed the declarative/procedural (DP) model, a theoretical framework that provides key insights into the neural bases of language learning and use. His work is widely cited and has applications for the study of the neurocognition of language, memory, and other cognitive domains. Dr. Ullman’s Path: The Road to Neuroscience Dr. Ullman’s interest in science stems from his childhood experiences. “When I was a kid I was always interested in nature and science. My best friend’s father, in San Francisco, was an early geneticist, and I thought, ‘Oh, genetics would be cool,’” he said. “When I went to Harvard, there was no genetics major, but there was a biochem major — the closest I could get — so I majored in that at first.” But after beginning his studies, he said, “I just didn’t enjoy being in a lab with Petri dishes; it wasn’t my thing.” After his sophomore year, Ullman took four years off of school to help start up a computer company and then travel internationally. He then returned to Harvard. However, he switched his major to computer science, with a focus on cognitive science and language. He initially hoped the field would prove useful in launching another company, this time in machine translation.  After delving deeper into the science, though, Dr. Ullman decided to instead pursue a Ph.D. at MIT, where he began studying language under the mentorship of Dr. Steven Pinker, a renowned psychologist in the field of psycholinguistics. Although fascinated by his mentor’s cognitive approach to language, Dr. Ullman sought to study the neurobiological mechanisms of language. With guidance from both Dr. Pinker and another mentor, Dr. Suzanne Corkin, Ullman began to study patients with neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases. These conditions primarily impaired different regions of the brain, offering a unique window into how language is processed neurologically. It was during this research that he developed the DP model. Foundations of Memory: Declarative and Procedural Systems To understand the DP model, it is necessary to understand the two different types of memory at play in the human (and animal) brain. Psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists have long classified learning and memory into two main categories: declarative memory and procedural memory. Declarative memory includes the learning and memory of information that is consciously known and can be voluntarily declared, such as hard facts and events. Procedural memory, which underlies the non-conscious learning and retrieval of skills, oversees learning activities like riding a bike or typing without looking down at the keyboard. Researchers have found that these two memory systems operate in distinct regions of the brain: while declarative memory primarily involves structures in the medial temporal lobe such as the hippocampus, procedural memory largely involves the basal ganglia. These two “classes” of memory are the focus of the DP model. Formulating the Declarative/Procedural Model The DP model posits that the brain encodes different components of language in different regions of the brain, corresponding to the pre-established memory systems associated with declarative and procedural memory. Previous research established two main components of language. First, there is the mental lexicon. This refers to the collection of words that exist in human mental repertoire — essentially, the connections the brain has made between a group of sounds (e.g., ca-ta-list) and their meaning (e.g., your favorite student magazine/a substance that increases reaction rates). The second component is mental grammar. This refers to the operations your brain performs — automatically in a first language — to communicate using the mental lexicon. For example, most native English speakers would not have to think twice before saying “I ate an apple” when referring to a past event, versus “I’ll eat an apple” in reference to the future. As Dr. Ullman analyzed the results of his experimental study participants, he observed striking contrasts in the types of language impairments seen across different neurological disorders. While Alzheimer’s patients mostly displayed impairments in learning and retrieving words from their mental lexicon, Parkinson’s patients displayed more grammatical errors. While pondering his work on a hike with his girlfriend, Dr. Ullman had an “aha moment” that eventually gave rise to what he now terms the DP model.  “Grammatical deficits may be due to problems with underlying procedural memory; lexical deficits with declarative memory,” he said. “Everything flowed from there. Of course, my current conception is very different — that’s science — but it started as a real epiphanic moment.” Dr. Ullman realized that the contrasting results he observed in his study participants seemed to align with the characteristic patterns of neurodegeneration in both diseases: while Alzheimer’s involves degeneration of temporal-lobe structures, which are associated with declarative memory, Parkinson’s involves degeneration in the basal ganglia, associated with procedural memory.  Scientific and Practical Applications of The DP Model Language, Disorders, and Evolution The DP model has vast applications. Since first introducing his theory in 2001, Dr. Ullman has continued to study aspects of language neurocognition, such as second-language acquisition and bilingualism, language disorders, and other aspects of non-linguistic cognition, such as learning math and music. Beyond illuminating the physical basis of language and its implications in the clinical setting, the DP model also highlights important principles of evolutionary biology that help scientists understand human linguistic development. “The procedural model is premised on the idea in evolutionary biology that new functions tend to rely on existing mechanisms that are repurposed for that function,” he said.  Ullman’s model both supports and is supported by this evolutionary perspective, suggesting that humans’ newly acquired capacity for language has organized itself in the context of the brain’s pre-existing learning structures — specifically, those underlying declarative and procedural memory. Applications for Students: Optimizing Memory Science for Effective Learning Dr. Ullman’s work has been influential in bridging the cognitive aspects of linguistic functions with their underlying neurobiology. His findings contribute not only to the study of language but also to broader research in learning and cognition. Many Catalyst readers — especially those studying biology, psychology, or other STEM courses — likely engage in content memorization on a daily basis. This objective, which heavily involves declarative memory, not only requires understanding general principles and details, but also associating them with words — for example, the term “mitochondria” with “powerhouse of the cell.”  The DP model provides insights that can aid intentional information learning. By characterizing the brain regions that facilitate this type of language memorization, such as the hippocampus and temporal lobe, researchers can leverage memory studies on these brain regions to identify optimal study strategies. 
 Currently, Dr. Ullman directs the Medical Neuroscience course for medical students at Georgetown Medical School. Drawing on research on declarative memory, he structures his own lectures to facilitate effective learning. Describing some of these strategies, Dr. Ullman notes the value of repetition of concepts, as well as the enhanced benefits of spacing out subsequent repetitions to promote information retention. Another key strategy he notes is “the testing effect,” also known as “retrieval practice,” which emphasizes the benefit of actively recalling information — as opposed to passively hearing  — in long-term memory formation. Dr. Ullman makes sure to ask his students questions in real time to encourage active recall as well. Conclusion: Integrating Language, Memory, and Mind For students navigating lectures, lab reports, or exams, it can be easy to think of language and memory as separate and unrelated systems — Dr. Ullman’s research shows us just how connected they are. The DP model doesn’t just explain how the brain processes language; it also enables us to learn more effectively by understanding how we think, and even to appreciate how our brains have evolved to allow us to perform these functions. Whether memorizing metabolic pathways in biochemistry, synthesis reactions in organic chemistry, or an equation in physics, the brain is constantly utilizing declarative and procedural memory systems to make sense of the world. Dr. Ullman’s work helps to elucidate these functions and advance the work of neuroscientists, psychologists, educators, and even students by reframing our understanding of the biological machinery that underlies some of our most human capacities.

Procedural memory, which underlies the non-conscious learning and retrieval of skills, oversees learning activities like riding a bike or typing without looking down at the keyboard.

From revolutionizing computing with brain-shaped technology and developing innovative treatments for multiple sclerosis to advancing therapies for aggressive breast cancer, these efforts are pushing the boundaries of science as we know it. Distinguished researchers like Dr. Gina Adam, Dr. Jeffrey Huang, and Dr. Barry Hudson are pioneering cutting-edge research that expands modern scientific understanding and offers tangible solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges — all from the nation’s capital. Dr. Gina Adam – Neuromorphic Computing and Nanotechnology As the world advances in its technological capabilities through powerful tools like AI, the search for more effective and advanced computing systems only grows. Dr. Gina Adam, an Assistant Professor at George Washington University, is working to develop neuromorphic computing and nanotechnology toward this aim. The word “neuromorphic” can be broken down into the Greek words neûron, meaning “string, nerve” and referring to the brain, and morphē, meaning “shape.” Simply put, neuromorphic computing employs computational methods to mimic the function of the brain by simulating the neural and synaptic processes it performs. Dr. Adam’s work focuses on developing “memristors,” which she describes as resistors with memory to recall how much charge they’ve passed. Meanwhile, traditional computers process information using a rigid structure of transistors and binary code of zeroes and ones. Although this approach has worked thus far, it is less effective with higher-complexity tasks like pattern recognition and real-time learning, and when it does attempt those complex tasks, it consumes vast amounts of energy. This limitation lies in how the transistors use sequential processing for information. Imagine that a large image is placed in front of someone. As soon as their eyes see it, the brain processes the information on several tracks — an ability called parallel processing — such that the experience stimulates pathways that evoke feelings from the amygdala, perception in the occipital cortex, and memory recall in the hippocampus. Transistors, however, must process each pixel one by one, requiring extensive time and energy. Close-up view on a nanotechnology electronic system 3D rendering by sdecoret So, How Do Memristors Work? The key to a memristor’s memory lies in resistive switching, which is typically achieved through ion migration or phase changes in the material. The most common way scientists use them to “remember information” is through ion migration, which occurs when an applied voltage creates or fills oxygen vacancies (missing atoms) of metal oxides such as titanium dioxide or hafnium oxide inside the memristor, creating new conductive pathways or removing old ones, effectively “encoding” a retained memory state even after the current information is terminated. Unlike binary logic, memristors can process a range of values, enabling them to perform parallelized tasks like image and speech recognition. How Dr. Adam’s Work is Revolutionizing Computing One of Dr. Adam’s most notable developments is 3D memristor crossbar arrays — a design that stacks memristors into layers, improving their efficiency. Currently, her lab focuses on integrating a novel category of memristors called ReRAM switches. These two-terminal electronic devices incorporate resistive switching, which involves a dielectric material that can rapidly adjust its resistance into arrays and dense matrices when sufficient voltage is applied. The ability to stack and integrate memristors together offers immense potential for the development of smaller, smarter, and more efficient devices with higher processing capacities per unit space. This revolutionary design additionally offers potential to develop an energy-efficient data center capable of processing massive data inputs using only a fraction of its current power consumption. Finally, the “memory” stored in these devices may also provide a unique ability to give them “digital fingerprints,” making them less vulnerable to malicious hackers and cybersecurity threats. Dr. Adam’s innovative research in neuromorphic computing and nanotechnology is forging a new path in the development of high-functioning and high-processing machines. Her work is paving the way for a new generation of AI-powered technologies with the capacity to shape industries and improve countless lives. Dr. Jeffrey Huang – Advancements in Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease affecting  roughly 2.8 million people worldwide, according to the National MS Society in 2019. Over time, the disease causes progressive nerve damage, physical disability, and cognitive decline. Despite decades of research, scientists have struggled to develop effective treatments capable of repairing years’ worth of nerve damage. Dr. Jeffrey Huang, an Associate Professor of Biology at Georgetown University, is spearheading innovative research that may offer hope for MS patients in the nation’s capital. A hallmark feature of MS that underlies many of its symptoms is the demyelination of neurons. Like a computer, the neurons of the brain and spinal cord use electricity to communicate with one another and mediate quick information processing. In order to maximize their communication speed, many neuronal fibers are insulated by myelin sheaths, a fatty layer of Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes that wrap themselves along the axons and prevent ions from diffusing out, maximizing their current speed. In MS, the immune system wrongly attacks and destroys these myelin, impairing neuronal communication drastically. Dr. Huang studies remyelination — the process of repairing these protective myelin sheaths — and his discoveries in neuroinflammation and brain repair mechanisms have paved the way for new therapies and redefined our prior understanding of the brain’s innate ability to heal itself. Image Credit: Multiple Sclerosis by blueringmedia Why is Remyelination Critical? Many of the symptoms observed in MS, such as muscle weakness, impaired coordination of movements, and vision problems, result from the slowed signaling that occurs upon loss of myelin. Moreover, the high energy required for the neurons to communicate following the loss of the myelin sheaths makes them especially vulnerable to a process called excitotoxicity, which causes neuronal death. Current treatments mainly focus on suppressing the immune response, which helps to slow the progression of MS, but does not address the underlying demyelination issue. Some of Dr. Huang’s most significant contributions to MS research elucidate the crucial role of microglia, the brain’s resident immune cell, in clearing damaged myelin and promoting its repair. His research shows that when appropriately activated, microglia release cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that support the maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, enabling them to produce myelin and repair some of the nerve damage. In 2023, Dr. Huang and his team developed a drug that successfully reversed the effects of late-stage MS in animal models. Utilizing the compound JPH034, an inhibitor of the LAT1 transporter, the drug effectively reduces the quantity of pro-inflammatory factors that induce microglia to cause damage. As inflammation is relieved, OCPs successfully mature and re-myelinate neurons, essentially repairing the damage caused by the disease. As Dr. Huang’s research continues to progress from animal models to clinical applications, it has the potential to transform the lives of millions of MS patients, helping them restore their healthy neurological function and slow the progression of their disease. Dr. Barry Hudson – Targeting Triple-Negative Breast Cancer In the realm of oncology, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains an intimidating challenge that affects countless women. In fact, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported  that about 2,088,849 cases of TNBC were recorded in 2018, making it a common cancer in women. TNBC is a particularly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that derives its name from the fact that it lacks the three receptors commonly targeted in breast cancer treatments: estrogen, which controls female sexual and reproductive development, progesterone, which regulates the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and other aspects of reproduction, and HER2, a protein that controls cell growth. The absence of these receptors makes conventional hormonal therapies ineffective in TNBC, leaving patients with minimal options for treatment and a pressing need for innovative approaches. At Georgetown University, Dr. Barry Hudson, an Associate Professor in the Department of Oncology, is leading impactful research that has the potential to transform TNBC treatment.

Targeting Inflammatory Pathways in TNBC Dr. Hudson’s laboratory is researching the relationship between inflammation and breast cancer metastasis. His work focuses on the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), a multi-ligand receptor that binds to harmful molecules called Glycation End-products (AGEs). These molecules, which are secreted due to factors like aging, stress, and high blood pressure, accumulate as waste products in the body. Why does RAGE matter? When AGEs bind to RAGE, they trigger inflammation and oxidative stress, which can further prompt the progression of various diseases, such as cancer, diabetes complications, and heart disease. Even though the body can typically clear AGEs, the overactivation of RAGE in TNBC causes persistent inflammation and damage, which increases tumor growth by stimulating cell division, enhancing metastasis of the cancer and allowing it to spread to other parts of the body. Targeting RAGE Dr. Hudson’s laboratory has developed novel RAGE inhibitors that have demonstrated potential in reducing inflammation and metastasis in animal models. Dr. Hudson and his team have repurposed a small-molecule RAGE inhibitor used for Alzheimer’s treatment, called TTP488 (Azeliragon), to assess its efficacy against TNBC. Recent studies in mouse models of TNBC have demonstrated that Azeliragon effectively inhibits cancer metastasis to the lungs. Additionally, the inhibition of RAGE by Azeliragon disrupted key signaling pathways involved in tumor cell adhesion (Akt), migration (Pyk2), and invasion (STAT3), which are essential for reducing the risk of cancer metastasis. Dr. Hudson’s innovative research on RAGE inhibition represents a promising avenue for treating TNBC. By repurposing Azeliragon, his work has the potential to revolutionize TNBC treatment, reduce the burden of metastatic disease, and provide more personalized and effective therapies. This innovative approach brings oncology researchers closer to improving the quality of life for those battling one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer.

Environmental health scientist Sacoby Wilson is leading a movement to put the tools and products of research directly in the hands of the people. Empowering, Informing, and Including Communities In communities across the nation, a foul taste hangs in the air and water, a constant reminder of the industries and pollutants that surround them. Complaints of burning throats and asthma are common, but complaints to officials fall on deaf ears. With many anecdotes but little hard evidence, the struggles of communities go unaddressed while they suffer from environmental and health hazards.  The gap between what people in affected communities experience and what official data say is a battleground across the nation. For generations, scientific research has been a top-down affair, a closed-off process in the “ivory tower” of academia. Researchers with their own questions would descend on communities, collect data, and publish in a closed academic journal, overlooking the residents' most pressing concerns. A new movement is growing, allowing communities to be engaged in the research process from start to finish, elevating their valuable input. This new approach, often called community-engaged research, is championed by scientists like Dr. Sacoby Wilson, director of The Health, Environmental and Economic Justice lab (T.H.E.E.J. lab) at the University of Maryland, College Park. Dr. Wilson has worked on environmental justice through community-engaged research since his time as a PhD student at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where he studied the impacts of industrial hog farms on community health and air quality. Dr. Wilson described how engaging people most impacted by certain health hazards elevates the research being done, saying, “When we think about community engagement in general and in the research enterprise, it helps to really bring the community's voice into the work and show the value of their contextual knowledge and expertise.” He drew a sharp distinction between the motivations of research led by scientists versus led by communities, since community-engaged research can be more comprehensive and inclusive by asking questions that cover the full experience of the community and get more relevant data to drive solutions. “Their lived experience is a form of data, so they’re the experts on their everyday lives,” he said.  Empowering communities through community–engaged science will not only lead to a better impact of the research to benefit the community, but it may also help improve public trust in science. Throughout our conversation, there were many repeating themes of power differences and division in traditional research methods, and between academics and the public. “There's a lot of baked-in inequities in how we do science,” Dr. Wilson said, further elaborating how traditional research is driven in a top-down manner, with many differences in funding and power between academic institutions and community groups. These power imbalances drive a sharp divide between academics and citizens. Engaging the community in science by involving them at every step and empowering them with skills along the way can help improve communication and trust between researchers and the public, something that is lacking in the present day. Dr. Wilson pointed out that this division could be part of the reason for widespread anti-science sentiment in the US. Conducting research inspired by citizens is a way of “ground truthing lived experience,” he said.  The division Dr. Wilson described extends beyond an academic setting. There is a growing national crisis of confidence in science. Public trust in science has fluctuated in recent years, and it remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, according to a Pew Research Center poll . Only 45% of US adults say that it is accurate to describe scientists as good communicators. There is also a divide in confidence between democrats and republicans, with republicans expressing less overall trust in scientists to act in the best interests of the public.  Part of this mistrust–as Dr. Wilson alluded to–could be a lack of understanding between citizens and scientists. When communities are left out of the research of their lived experiences, they feel iced out, not understanding or feeling like they benefit from the scientific process. Additionally, when scientists are used to publishing in academic journals and using field-specific jargon, they may do a bad job of communicating their work’s importance and relevance to society.  From the Community, for the Community  One of Dr. Wilson’s most impactful areas of research involves air quality monitoring through a network of deployed indoor and outdoor air quality monitors. He collaborates with multiple groups, from community organizations and government agencies to other universities. These networks collect data to help inform and empower communities afflicted by harmful air quality. The project makes efficient use of resources, colocating some of its cheaper, widely spread monitors with EPA equipment. This strategy allows researchers to calibrate the low-cost sensors for accuracy and spread them out over a much larger area than is possible with more expensive equipment. By collecting, visualizing, and analyzing air quality data in affected communities, Dr. Wilson and his colleagues can help to inform the public and identify specific sources of pollution and implement reduction strategies to improve public health. This researcher-community collaboration is critical for the project. Community partners, who have enhanced knowledge of their area or where it is most important to monitor, helped to plan the deployment of air quality monitors. Their input is a valuable addition that can help to make the data collected more relevant and impactful.  Air quality monitoring sensors that are used in T.H.E.E.J. lab projects at Turner Station, Cheverly, and Curtis Bay, Maryland Dr. Wilson is involved in many other projects looking at environmental hazards like the effects of industrial chicken farms in the eastern shore of Maryland and southern Delaware, as well as incinerator and port pollution in Newark. These projects span an array of pollution issues from different sources and help inform decision makers and educate communities on these issues.  Environmental and economic justice are inextricably linked, with poor environmental quality leading to a range of health conditions, like asthma, which additionally have increased economic costs for those afflicted. Some communities are also more affected by a lack of access to necessary infrastructure, one example of which is inadequate sewer and water infrastructure  in low-income African American communities. Dr. Wilson's work helps to quantify and inform affected communities on the science behind what’s happening in their everyday lives, both validating their experiences and equipping them with the data to fight for change.  Driving Policy / Making an Impact Engaging the community in research, whether it is through community-based science or citizen science, leads to a greater understanding and impact. Elevating the voices of those most impacted and giving non-scientists the tools to shape their future will create better outcomes for both scientists and citizens. Engaging communities in scientific research has the potential to increase trust in science and drive policy decisions. As Dr. Wilson said, “communities want science that leads to real action and change, so to do that you have to translate the science and communicate to decision makers, like policy makers.” Empowering communities to tell their stories through science helps to keep policy and people at the forefront of research, paving the way for a brighter, more equitable future.",,0,"en",2025-09-06T04:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""foo"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""For communities plagued by pollution, science feels like something done to them, not for them.

After eight months, they found the cause: a rare pathogen once weaponized by the U.S. military. The surreal experience would change everything, leading her to become an expert on her own disease and discover a new calling at the intersection of public health and national security. A Timely Intersection of Public Health and National Security On September 10, 2001, a young Rebecca Katz, a public health doctoral student, submitted a paper outside the typical realm of classic epidemiology — Biological Weapons as a Public Health issue — a topic that was not widely covered at the time.  However, within less than a year, following both the attacks on 9/11 and the Anthrax Attacks, Katz’s interest in the intersection of public health and national security was no longer a science-fiction concept, but a part of a burgeoning field of medical research.  In her career since, Dr. Katz has demonstrated incredible efficacy for tackling critical issues ranging from biosecurity and urban planning to pandemic preparedness and disease outbreak emergency responses. The Catalyst had a chance to sit down with her and take a deep dive into her career and insights, spanning from governmental to academic work.  From Global Health to National Security Katz’s career, like many, began with ambitions that looked quite different from where she ultimately landed. Raised in a family deeply rooted in public health, dinner table conversations didn’t revolve around investment banking or law school applications, but instead around health, equity, and the medical systems that shape people’s lives.  “I really thought I wanted to do a kind of resource allocation for global health policy,” Katz said. “I was going to be a health economist and study things like the impact of access to clean water.” However, before jumping into graduate school to pursue this goal, Katz had an itch for something else: travel. Determined to immerse herself in the kind of global work she hoped to one day lead, she convinced her parents to support a year-long volunteer trip to India.  “I was going to spend a year doing volunteer work.” Katz said. “The plan was to spend the first six months in southern India working helping out in maternal and child health clinics and then spend the last six months volunteering for Mother Teresa.” But that plan unraveled when Katz fell gravely ill. After just a few months, she was forced to cut her trip short and return to the U.S., where doctors struggled to diagnose her. For eight months, she remained sick while medical teams searched for answers. Ultimately, they discovered she had contracted a rare pathogen that had once been weaponized by the U.S. military in the 1950s as part of its former offensive biological weapons program.  This experience, harrowing and surreal, would change everything, she said.  While enduring her illness, Katz began her Master’s in Public Health at Yale University, choosing the school not just for its academics, but for its access to top-tier doctors to treat her illness. She found herself in a strange dual reality. “I was discovering the field of epidemiology… And I was also becoming really smart on my own disease,” Katz said. “If you have the intellectual capacity to do so, you have to become your own advocate.” In the process of becoming an expert in her own disease, Katz stumbled  upon a body of literature about biological weapons and biodefense, topics that had not yet entered the mainstream of undergraduate study. Her experience gave her a uniquely visceral connection to the subject. With a background in policy, economics, and epidemiology, she saw a new convergence of disciplines: national security and global health. Though there were few formal paths to follow in this emerging field, Katz couldn’t shake the feeling that this was where she was meant to be, she said. She began attending niche meetings, often the only woman in the room, and usually the youngest by far, slowly carving out space in a field that hadn’t yet fully formed.  Pioneering a New Field in the Wake of National Crises By the time Katz decided to pursue a PhD in 2000, she had a clear idea of what she wanted to study: the intersection of disease and security. Most schools didn’t quite know what to make of her proposal, but Katz pushed forward, undeterred. Eventually, a former dean from her program at Yale, who had now moved to Princeton, encouraged her to pursue her graduate studies within their School of Public and International Affairs (formerly the Woodrow Wilson School). There, Katz had the opportunity to combine courses in Epidemiology and National Security, and would soon be writing about biological weapons as a public health threat — inadvertently submitting one of her exam papers on September 10, 2001. “The thing everyone had been humoring me about, well, it became a real thing after 9/11 and the Anthrax attacks,” Katz said. This background set the stage for a meteoric rise for the field of biosecurity, a sphere that Katz’s background perfectly aligned with. Here she sought out internships within the intelligence community and simultaneously collected data for her dissertation. Through an historical analysis of biological agents used in warfare, Katz declassified almost 9,000 pages of documents to finish her thesis. From there, having earned her PhD, Dr. Katz began consulting for the U.S. Department of State. Between 2004 and 2019, she supported U.S. delegations to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in Geneva, Switzerland, advising on global norms around the peaceful use of biological science and the prevention of biological weapons development.  Palais des Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, home of the United Nations Office at Geneva In parallel, Katz worked closely with global partners, including the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Health Emergencies Programme, where she shared expertise on emergency preparedness and the International Health Regulations. At the policy level, Katz collaborated with ministries of health and foreign affairs in countries such as Uganda, India, and Jordan, helping to design and evaluate pandemic preparedness plans, infectious disease reporting systems, and public health emergency operations centers. Her advisory work has also extended to the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), where she has supported the design of the program.. However, it wasn’t long before Katz found herself drawn back into academia. In 2005, a former mentor encouraged her to lecture in his course at the George Washington University (GWU) School of Medicine. Lecturing led to more interactions with the GWU faculty, and soon the School of Public Health — now the Milken Institute School of Public Health — soon offered Katz a faculty position. There, she continued her work at the intersection of epidemiology and national security, ultimately receiving a prestigious K Award from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to support her research. Still consulting with the State Department, Katz eventually transitioned her research group to Georgetown University in 2016. She now leads their Center for Global Health Science and Security, where she has continued to shape the field of health security through policy research, education, and public engagement. Applying Decades of Experience to the Front Lines of a Global Pandemic In early 2020, as the global threat of COVID-19 began to emerge, Katz’s years of experience positioned her at the forefront of the response. She was one of the first scientists in the United States to publicly call for the outbreak to be declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). On February 28, 2020, she published “ The Novel Coronavirus Originating in Wuhan, China   Challenges for Global Health Governance ” as a warning.  “We are now faced with the very real prospect that COVID-19 may become a pandemic,” Katz wrote in the publication. “Health leaders and policymakers should begin to plan for a pandemic.” While the WHO would not officially declare COVID-19 a pandemic until March 11, 2020,  Katz’s early call reflected the urgency that much of the public health community was beginning to feel.  Leading up to and following the 2020 election, Katz served on the Biden-Harris Transition COVID-19 team, helping shape public health strategies for the incoming administration. She also rejoined the State Department, serving under Secretary Antony Blinken as a senior advisor on pandemic response and global health security. For Katz and others in the field, identifying public health as a national security challenge became a lot more apparent after the COVID-19 pandemic.  A Framework for Future Preparedness Through Interdisciplinary Collaboration Katz has spent much of her career thinking about that question. For her, the answer is not rooted in a single discipline, tool, or institution. It is about collaboration. “When you’re responding to an outbreak, you don't just need epidemiologists. You need virologists, clinicians, politicians, economists, logisticians, behavioral scientists,” she said. In theory, that level of coordination sounds simple. In practice, it remains elusive.  “A challenge in academia is that it’s still organized in silos, but the problems we face are multidisciplinary,” Katz said. This obstacle was part of what motivated Katz to move her lab from GWU to Georgetown, where she hoped to foster a more multidisciplinary approach to research. However, interdisciplinarity amongst departments is not enough. Katz also believes Washington, D.C. holds a unique position in the field of health security. “The proximity to decision-makers is critical. You can walk down the street and have a coffee with someone at the HHS or State Department,” Katz said. “It’s not just about being near them — it’s about having a relationship where people know your work and trust your judgment.” To help bridge these gaps, Katz and her team have launched  several tools and initiatives aimed at building stronger, data-driven responses to pandemics. This includes the   Analysis and Mapping of Policies for Emerging Infectious Diseases (AMPED) project that catalogues global health policies and how they may affect outbreak outcomes. These tools reflect a core principle in Katz’s work: knowledge should be actionable. Whether writing early warnings, creating digital tools for decision-makers, or mentoring the next generation of public health leaders, her focus remains the same. The next pandemic is not a question of if , but when . The better the nation understands the systems that failed — and the people and partnerships that responded — the more prepared the country and the world will be to face the music.",,0,"en",2025-07-01T04:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO"",""lineHeight"":""1.5""}},""style"":{""paddingTop"":""0px"",""paddingBottom"":""0px""},""id"":""0nurq790"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Rebecca Katz’s plan to volunteer in India was unraveled by a severe illness that doctors in the U.S. struggled to diagnose.

We sat down with Holden Thorp to explore how one of the world’s leading science journals navigates this challenge. Join us as he reflects on his journey and the evolving role of scientific storytelling. Background In a time where trust in science is eroding and public discourse grows more polarized, accurately and effectively communicating new discoveries is becoming increasingly important for progress. Science communication is not only essential to spread information in a way that excites and informs people on the world around us, but to maintain a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and innovative scientific environment. Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of  Science Magazine , has taken on the role to mediate the efflux of such discovery, giving him a unique perspective on how science and related communication can be approached. Career trajectories can evolve unexpectedly—rather than following an idealized course, Dr. Thorp notes that he ""didn't set out to be an editor in chief at Science ."" His career has spanned academia and leadership: first, as a laboratory researcher and associate professor at North Carolina State University; later, as Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and today, as both a professor at George Washington University and head of one of the highest impact science journals in the world. The Communication Conundrum A predisposition towards communication that is commonly held within the scientific community is that those who communicate science must also be experts in the laboratory. The traditional academic hierarchy often privileges research credentials over communicative abilities, an ideology that—as the United States continues to embrace anti-intellectualism—must be challenged. Thorp addresses this as a fatal flaw for science communicative efforts today: “Why does a great explainer need a pipette? If someone is good at explaining things to people, asking questions, understanding how science affects their lives—we need them to be doing all of those things, whether they’re also good in the laboratory or not.” Constructing restrictions to how scientific knowledge can circulate only succeeds in gatekeeping necessary paths that the public would otherwise take advantage of. Science communication, as a whole, exists not as a way to educate the general public on certain scientific topics—it is expressed as a way to excite  and get people engaged  in science; Thorp emphasizes that the path of treating science communication merely a vector for educational purposes has its faults: ""Why should people learn science if they have a lot of other things to do? It would make for better citizens—but we’d have better citizens if people learned a lot of things, not just science."" Bridging the Publication Gap To move forward, it's incredibly important to maintain the flow of information through engagement with platforms that expand science communication. Broader access to science is achieved through publishers such as Science, PNAS , Cell , and more. The role that these publishers play has never been to serve as mass communicators to the general public; instead, they were built to validate, archive, and advance scientific discovery, taking on immense responsibility to facilitate communication between researchers. ""It’s important when you talk about science communication to understand what Science’s role is. We are not in the business of communicating science to the general public—we are a publication for scientists."" As the demands for transparency, accessibility, and public engagement with science have grown, this traditional model has revealed its limitations, raising urgent questions about how the scientific enterprise can and should interact with the wider world. Thorp makes an important distinction: scientific journals exist primarily to facilitate communication between researchers, not to popularize findings for a lay audience. It's a necessary role, but not a complete solution to the communication gap.  DC's Role in the Future The solution to help solidify an integral role for science communicators in the coming years stems from Washington DC, the center of discourse for the attack on higher education—as well as the center for the world’s most prestigious institutes and facilities including the NIH, National Academy of Sciences, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and more. “DC has always been a center for science, it’s where most of the scientific societies are located, including mine. It’s where the NIH and many other national labs are, including several excellent research universities and hospitals—when you put all those things together, it’s one of the places that (is really great for science). It’s exciting.  The responsibility to bridge this gap doesn't fall only to journalists, doctors, or research specialists; it belongs to all those engaged with science. At institutions like Planet Forward , the D.C. Science Writers Association , and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) , students and professionals alike are already working to bring science out of the ivory tower and into everyday conversations. These organizations are shaping the future of scientific communication.  A Call to Action As Thorp continues to advocate for scientific engagement, we are reminded that all of us have a part to play as members of the scientific community. Whether you're a student passionate about climate change, a researcher with a story to tell, or simply curious about how science affects your world, now is the time to step in. Participate, write, speak, and amplify. Science needs your voice.",,0,"en",2025-05-07T04:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""evch48223"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""In an era of growing skepticism and polarized discourse, clear science communication is more vital than ever.

She uses the universe's oldest light to piece together our cosmic origins. But as the climate for science in America shifts, she questions whether the nation that drew her in will remain the best place on Earth to continue reaching for the stars. Introduction Dr. Duilia De Mello’s passion for astronomy inspired her to reach for the stars and even discover some of her own. But how did this accomplished Brazilian NASA researcher and physics professor make her way to DC? Dr. Duilia De Mello (Credit: Wikipedia) A Place to grow As a child, Dr. De Mello was curious about everything but could never find any answers, so she set out to discover them for herself. She sought to become an expert in the field of astronomy, which led her to pursue a Ph.D and participate in two post-doctorate programs at major telescopes located in Chile and Maryland. She even discovered a supernova in 1997 during her time at the European Southern Observatory in Chile. After completing her education, she became a professor at Chalmers University in Sweden.  A few years later, Dr. De Mello got an offer to work at NASA Goddard in Maryland. She needed a sponsor to do so, since only American citizens can work for government agencies, and Catholic University of America offered—where she has now worked for over 20 years. She is now a senior researcher at NASA and a tenured professor and vice provost at Catholic University. Dr. De Mello really likes working in DC because, “it's where all the action is.” She pointed out that when you look closely, there is a lot of research happening in and around DC, especially with all the universities and government research facilities. There are opportunities here, regardless of discipline, with organizations like NASA, the National Institute of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and much more. Dr. De Mello felt that  ending up in DC happened organically for her based on her connections and career aspirations. Quote: “working in DC was kind of a natural choice from the beginning” NASA Goddard Space Flight Center where Dr. De Mello works with her team to conduct research ( By NASA Goddard/Bill Hrybyk) Current research Dr. De Mello’s interests and education focused on galaxy formation and evolution, and she works on a multitude of projects in this area, some of which she spearheaded. Her work at NASA consists of deep space imaging using the Hubble SpaceTelescope. Her team analyzes the images and data from deep space and compares it to our own galaxy, the Milky Way, to help understand how our galaxy formed and what the formation process looked like.  Here’s how it works: it takes time for things to travel from one place to another, including light. But on Earth, light travels such small distances at such a fast speed that it appears instant to us. However, this is not the case for outer space. Even for something seemingly as close as our sun (which is about 93 million miles away), it still takes light 8 minutes to reach Earth. Now imagine looking at something a million times farther away—suddenly the light we see wasn’t produced just minutes ago, but years or even hundred of years earlier. So when you look at objects deep in the universe, you’re not just seeing incredibly far away, but also back in time! Dr. De Mello and her team use this to their advantage; when they look at data from a distant galaxy that is just starting to form, they can identify parts that are similar to the Milky Way, and use the information to piece together how it formed.  Dr. De Mello has also been studying blue blobs that result from colliding galaxies. Blue blobs are young stars that are born from the aftermath of a galactic collision. When galaxies “collide,” they don’t actually crash into each other—galaxies are filled with mostly empty space, so in reality they just slowly pass through each other. But the gravity from all the stars, planets, and other things in one galaxy can have a big impact on the other. This causes some gas to be pushed out of both galaxies, which is left in space. From the gas, stars are born.  Blue blobs captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. (Credit: NASA, ESA, and D. de Mello [Catholic University of America/GSFC]) Has America lost faith in science? Despite the success that Dr. De Mello has found in DC, she worries that her time here is coming to an end. Each year thousands of scientists immigrate to the US to seek unique opportunities—. according to the American Immigration Council, almost 25% of the STEM field is made up of foreign-born workers like Dr. De Mello. However, a recent shift in government leadership and public sentiment has drastically impacted the scientific community. Cuts in research funding, distrust in experts, limitations on what can be taught, and negative views on immigration are all starting to push talented scientists elsewhere. Dr. De Mello even says that she came to the United States because it had everything she was looking for. For the past few decades there has been a big push to find scientists of diverse backgrounds and remain one of the leading countries in technological advancements. But as the leadership and American public’s priorities change, it seems the focus is starting to shift. And if it stops being a place where Dr. De Mello has the support and funding to continue her work then she says it will be time for her to leave.  “You only do science if you have the proper condition to do good science.” What’s next? In the future, Dr. De Mello is planning to start a project with the James Webb Telescope. While the Hubble has been around for over 30 years, the James Webb Space Telescope was launched in 2021. Not only does it provide much clearer images than the Hubble, but it is an infrared telescope, which allows it to accurately capture light from the opposite side of the universe . Dr. De Mello is excited about this because it will allow us to see what the universe looked like 13 to 14 billion years ago, when it was young (relatively speaking). This would better help her to understand the history of the universe and analyze how it has grown and evolved. By understanding the origins of the universe, we can get closer to understanding how life and humans came to be—and Dr. De Mello hopes to be able to continue to do so in DC. Although Dr De Mello didn’t plan to come here, she has felt like it’s the place for her for the past 20 years and hopefully it will continue to be for a while.  Comparison of the southern ring nebula between the Hubble (left) and James Webb (right) Space Telescopes ( Credit Left: Hubble Heritage Team [STScI/AURA/NASA/ESA]) (Credit Right: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI)",,0,"en",2025-09-07T04:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""05rx1330"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""From discovering supernovas to studying the birth of galaxies, Dr. Duilia De Mello's journey took her from Brazil to NASA in Washington, D.C.

Now imagine looking at something a million times farther away—suddenly the light we see wasn’t produced just minutes ago, but years or even hundred of years earlier. So when you look at objects deep in the universe, you’re not just seeing incredibly far away, but also back in time! Dr. De Mello and her team use this to their advantage; when they look at data from a distant galaxy that is just starting to form, they can identify parts that are similar to the Milky Way, and use the information to piece together how it formed. "",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""#000624""}}]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""zbf10457"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""q3mfi458"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Dr. De Mello has also been studying blue blobs that result from colliding galaxies.

But the gravity from all the stars, planets, and other things in one galaxy can have a big impact on the other. This causes some gas to be pushed out of both galaxies, which is left in space.

However, a recent shift in government leadership and public sentiment has drastically impacted the scientific community. Cuts in research funding, distrust in experts, limitations on what can be taught, and negative views on immigration are all starting to push talented scientists elsewhere. Dr. De Mello even says that she came to the United States because it had everything she was looking for. For the past few decades there has been a big push to find scientists of diverse backgrounds and remain one of the leading countries in technological advancements. But as the leadership and American public’s priorities change, it seems the focus is starting to shift. And if it stops being a place where Dr. De Mello has the support and funding to continue her work then she says it will be time for her to leave. "",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""#000624""}}]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""n6cgz475"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}}},{""style"":{},""blockquoteData"":{""indentation"":0},""id"":""ltqma476"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""ypp6n3776"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""“You only do science if you have the proper condition to do good science.”"",""decorations"":[]}}],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""},""indentation"":0}}],""type"":""BLOCKQUOTE""},{""type"":""DIVIDER"",""id"":""xdg7a3890"",""nodes"":[],""dividerData"":{""containerData"":{""textWrap"":false,""height"":{},""spoiler"":{},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""width"":{}},""lineStyle"":""SINGLE"",""width"":""LARGE"",""alignment"":""CENTER""}},{""style"":{},""id"":""bf8pv478"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""What’s next?"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""foreground"":""#000624""}}]}}],""headingData"":{""level"":2,""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""type"":""HEADING""},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""p8f9c3993"",""nodes"":[],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""88eks480"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""In the future, Dr. De Mello is planning to start a project with the James Webb Telescope.

So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future” - Steve Jobs. Every scientist begins their journey with a general sense of direction, attempting to become an expert in one field.  However, it is not always obvious what path your interests will lead you down. In many cases, this induces anxiety for those pursuing a career in STEM, as we are told to “figure out what you want to do” for the rest of your life. Sitting down with Professor Michael Keidar, we will trace the steps of his illustrious career backwards, learning about how he tackled these exact questions that landed him to work in applying his knowledge across diverse fields such as brain tumor therapy, satellite design, and electromagnetic-induced drug delivery. Plasma and Purpose: The Multifaceted Journey of Dr. Michael Keidar Who:  Professor Michael Keidar is The James A. Clark Professor of Mechanical Engineering at George Washington University. His main research interests focus on designing optimized propulsion technology for spacecrafts such as satellites, and developing nanoscale plasma technology. Despite this, some of his most well-known work was his application of cold plasmas in cancer therapy, demonstrating his ability to apply his work across fields. Professor Keidar completed his PhD at Tel Aviv University and Postdoc appointments at UC Berkeley and Cornell University. He recently received a DARPA grant to develop low flying satellites powered by atmospheric pressure differences.  Why:  Many believe a scientific career is limited to either purely basic research or theoretical expertise. However, Dr. Keidar demonstrates that one can be a trailblazer in both fundamental research and make an impact on the lives of others. Furthermore, his career showcases the importance of obtaining valuable skills that can be applied across fields, unlocking the potential to maintain interdisciplinary interests. Many of us can benefit from hearing the story of such an impactful scientist, who continues to trailblaze almost 30 years after he began.  Understanding the Fourth State of Matter: Plasma’s Role in the Universe Micropropulsion of Satellites. Cancer Therapy. Electromagnetic Induced Cellular Responses.  To the naked eye, these are wildly different fields, each separated by vast oceans of knowledge. However, Michael Keidar sees them all connected through the unifying state of the universe: plasma.  The three states of matter — solid, liquid, and gas — are commonly taught in Middle School science. However, the state that makes up over 99% of the universe, plasma, is almost always forgotten. Image Credit: “Blue glowing multidimensional plasma force field in space” by sakkmesterke. Licensed under an Education License.. Plasma is likely omitted from the standard middle school curriculum because it requires a deeper understanding of electromagnetic forces and ionization, both of which are taught in High School. Moving forward in our understanding of the world, we begin to learn about plasma, the state of matter that makes up over 99% of the universe. Everything from lightning to stars to fluorescent light bulbs is made of plasma.  To create plasma, a gas is superheated, leading many of the electrons to be stripped away. This induces an electrical imbalance on the gas particles that generate what we call “plasma.” Thus, plasma consists of highly energized particles, producing electrically conductive material that interacts strongly with the electromagnetic field.  And here lies the secret to the story of plasmas. The interaction of the highly charged species of particles in plasmas within the electromagnetic field induces an electromagnetic interaction. The fundamental ideas of plasma are the dots that Keidar connects throughout his career.  Lightning Strikes: How Plasma Found Michael Keidar Growing up in the USSR during the Cold War, Keidar was brought up in the thick of the Space Age. Naturally, Keidar began to ask questions about the fundamentals of spacecraft propulsion from a young age. From these interests, he completed his undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering with a focus on electrical space propulsion from the Kharkov Aviation Institute. His education focused primarily on practical applications, centering on designing more propulsion systems for efficient satellites to save energy and conserve space.  “At that time, [it] was considered quite advanced,” Keidar said. “The idea was to use electricity instead of heating fuel and oxidizer, you can reach much higher velocities and use less… but there are downsides as electricity is limited on satellites.”  Here, at the end of his undergraduate degree, he saw the first possibilities of plasma, beginning to study more fundamental questions dealing with the nature of plasmas as opposed to their application. After completing his PhD in Plasma Engineering at Tel Aviv University, Keidar could now focus more on using the natural properties of plasma to produce advancements. Due to the highly charged and extremely conductive fundamental properties of plasmas, Keidar produced work that harnessed these properties to propel spacecraft through the repulsive properties of the electromagnetic field..

The shift toward more plasma-centered research was furthered by two postdoc appointments at UC Berkeley and Cornell research labs. Now, after almost a decade of research under his belt and a transition toward plasma research, Keidar has amassed unparalleled expertise in the field. Yet, his desire to make advancements in applying these technologies never went away. Pursuing a Professorship at GW, Keidar simultaneously opened a research lab that married his interests in plasma research and aerospace propulsion. The Micropropulsion and Nanoparticles Lab helped focus his interests on extremely small spacecraft and plasma-based nanoparticles. Despite this, Keidar could not expect where his career would turn from here… Cold Plasmas: A Paradigm Shift Almost accidentally, Professor Keidar entered the Biomedical field in a momentous fashion. At the time, in the late 2010s, there was no Department of Biomedical Engineering at GW, yet there was a Biomedical Institute that funded several projects in other departments for biomedical research. Despite being housed in the Mechanical Engineering Department, Keidar sought projects that had biomedical applications for his plasma research. Here, he envisioned working with his “cold” plasmas. “We started to develop what we call cold plasmas. Typical plasma in a lab is millions of degrees Celsius; the trick here is to apply a very strong electromagnetic field, which creates positive ions extremely quickly, allowing for an energetic, room temperature plasma.”  The resulting cold plasma is a cocktail of reactive species, oxygen, nitrogen, and ozone compounds, all present in both the human body and the atmosphere. The creation of these charged species acts as a reservoir that can be called, if necessary, to correct some biological processes. In short, with a cold plasma induced in a cell, these necessary compounds can be delivered without harming the cell. The possibility to induce the creation of these species then affected the pattern of cell migration. “We alter the migration of cells and thought, maybe this would be good to slow down the migration of cells from tumor areas.” Through experiments at Johns Hopkins University, plasma therapy was found to selectively kill cancerous cells. This discovery led to the FDA approval of Canady Helios Cold Plasma to develop plasma therapy into a commercially viable product.  To this day, his plasma medicine research is still his most cited paper, although this remains outside of his “Foundational Work”. Despite this, the dots still connect, as all of this was possible from his understanding of Plasma Fundamentals.  The Marriage of Propulsion and Therapy After his stint focusing on biomedical applications, Keidar returned to the questions that had begun his career: Can we fly satellites low enough in orbit that the air they collect can be converted to plasma and used to cancel out the drag produced by the spacecraft? Typically, with plasma-induced propulsion, ions are expelled and induce a “jet effect”. Issues arise when the positive ions are ejected, as they take the positive charge and leave the satellite negatively charged. On large scales, such as a satellite, this induces such a large negative electrical differential that the positively charged particles are attracted back to the spacecraft, inhibiting the electromagnetic force.  In order to answer this question, Keidar had to look back on his fundamental understanding of plasma physics and atmospheric chemical interactions. Put simply, how can oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere help to solve this problem? One effect of oxygen at low energy is that electrons actually attach to oxygen atoms more strongly than the positively charged ions from the spacecraft. Thus, an expulsion of oxygen could potentially counterbalance the ionic buildup of negative charges.  To test this hypothesis, Keidar needed to call on his previous biomedical work, which involved understanding the same interactions but on a cellular level. When developing the cold plasma cancer therapy research, the interactions between all the induced chemical species from the plasma needed to be monitored to determine the side effects of the treatment. Now, with this database of chemical interactions, it was possible for Keidar to predict the outcomes of his plasma’s effects more precisely. These same species are the ones that interact in the Atmosphere.  Once again, Keidar proves how the dots continue to connect long after the dots begin to appear. Push the Needle Forward: Dr. Keidar’s Wisdom for Aspiring Scientists When asked to reflect on his career and any advice he’d give to aspiring scientists, Keidar focused on watering those curious questions that every scientist needs to have in order to succeed. “It’s hard to develop your direction when you chase the inconsistent interests of others, but you must resist that urge.” Now, at this stage in his career, as a Professor in the capital of the United States, he often finds the interests of others clouding his line of sight. NIH, NSF, DOE, DARPA, DOD, all government agencies that Michael Keidar has worked with to help advance the questions he chooses to attack. Although these groups are important in setting a trend in research, Keidar emphasizes the even greater importance of pursuing meaningful research that is both novel and applicable to real problems faced in these fields “Above all I recommend that people do not chase. Push the needle toward what you believe in” For aspiring scientists, becoming an “expert” in a field is an honor and a dream. To be able to help push forward your tiny corner of STEM is the goal of all professional scientists. At every stage of his career, Dr Keidar pursued what he believed was going to advance the lives of others.  His career has touched fields from brain tumors to satellite development. It begins to show the ever-growing collaborative nature of science, as not distinct disciplines but an orchestra of moving parts. To be able to say you push forward multiple fields, now this is the mark of a very special scientist. The more we study extraordinary people, the more we learn about the importance of connecting the dots. For Jobs, this was merging calligraphy into the design of his first Macintosh Computer. For Professor Michael Keidar, it is exploring the secrets of the fourth state of matter in the universe: plasma. My Own Reflections & Takeaways To me- an aspiring scientist with the expectations of a scientific career placed before me- I was moved by Professor Keidar’s story of creativity and curiosity across the numerous areas of research he has entered. I believe that in the face of an ever increasingly dynamic world, it is important to build skills that can transcend the static barriers of strict categories and instead pursue fundamental interests that can open the doors in even more ways.  For each of us, it is important to take a deep breath and follow our interests, constantly pushing to understand not just the surface, but the underlying mechanisms. Through understanding the core of any field, we can each unlock abilities to further our understanding of the applications of fundamental sciences and their impact on our society. I began with the Steve Jobs quote, legendarily spoken at the Stanford Commencement in 2005, and I believe the end of that quote helps to encapsulate this story as well:  “Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path.” To all the students currently trying to figure out what field they want to enter, what PhD program to enter, what research lab they want to join, or even what classes they want to take next semester, remember to follow your interests and think of the bigger picture.

Every scientist begins their journey with a general sense of direction, attempting to become an expert in one field.  However, it is not always obvious what path your interests will lead you down. In many cases, this induces anxiety for those pursuing a career in STEM, as we are told to “figure out what you want to do” for the rest of your life. Sitting down with Professor Michael Keidar, we will trace the steps of his illustrious career backwards, learning about how he tackled these exact questions that landed him to work in applying his knowledge across diverse fields such as brain tumor therapy, satellite design, and electromagnetic-induced drug delivery. Plasma and Purpose: The Multifaceted Journey of Dr. Michael Keidar Who:  Professor Michael Keidar is The James A. Clark Professor of Mechanical Engineering at George Washington University. His main research interests focus on designing optimized propulsion technology for spacecrafts such as satellites, and developing nanoscale plasma technology. Despite this, some of his most well-known work was his application of cold plasmas in cancer therapy, demonstrating his ability to apply his work across fields. Professor Keidar completed his PhD at Tel Aviv University and Postdoc appointments at UC Berkeley and Cornell University. He recently received a DARPA grant to develop low flying satellites powered by atmospheric pressure differences.  Why:  Many believe a scientific career is limited to either purely basic research or theoretical expertise. However, Dr. Keidar demonstrates that one can be a trailblazer in both fundamental research and make an impact on the lives of others. Furthermore, his career showcases the importance of obtaining valuable skills that can be applied across fields, unlocking the potential to maintain interdisciplinary interests. Many of us can benefit from hearing the story of such an impactful scientist, who continues to trailblaze almost 30 years after he began.  Understanding the Fourth State of Matter: Plasma’s Role in the Universe Micropropulsion of Satellites. Cancer Therapy. Electromagnetic Induced Cellular Responses.  To the naked eye, these are wildly different fields, each separated by vast oceans of knowledge. However, Michael Keidar sees them all connected through the unifying state of the universe: plasma.  The three states of matter — solid, liquid, and gas — are commonly taught in Middle School science. However, the state that makes up over 99% of the universe, plasma, is almost always forgotten. Image Credit: “Blue glowing multidimensional plasma force field in space” by sakkmesterke. Licensed under an Education License.. Plasma is likely omitted from the standard middle school curriculum because it requires a deeper understanding of electromagnetic forces and ionization, both of which are taught in High School. Moving forward in our understanding of the world, we begin to learn about plasma, the state of matter that makes up over 99% of the universe. Everything from lightning to stars to fluorescent light bulbs is made of plasma.  To create plasma, a gas is superheated, leading many of the electrons to be stripped away. This induces an electrical imbalance on the gas particles that generate what we call “plasma.” Thus, plasma consists of highly energized particles, producing electrically conductive material that interacts strongly with the electromagnetic field.  And here lies the secret to the story of plasmas. The interaction of the highly charged species of particles in plasmas within the electromagnetic field induces an electromagnetic interaction. The fundamental ideas of plasma are the dots that Keidar connects throughout his career.  Lightning Strikes: How Plasma Found Michael Keidar Growing up in the USSR during the Cold War, Keidar was brought up in the thick of the Space Age. Naturally, Keidar began to ask questions about the fundamentals of spacecraft propulsion from a young age. From these interests, he completed his undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering with a focus on electrical space propulsion from the Kharkov Aviation Institute. His education focused primarily on practical applications, centering on designing more propulsion systems for efficient satellites to save energy and conserve space.  “At that time, [it] was considered quite advanced,” Keidar said. “The idea was to use electricity instead of heating fuel and oxidizer, you can reach much higher velocities and use less… but there are downsides as electricity is limited on satellites.”  Here, at the end of his undergraduate degree, he saw the first possibilities of plasma, beginning to study more fundamental questions dealing with the nature of plasmas as opposed to their application. After completing his PhD in Plasma Engineering at Tel Aviv University, Keidar could now focus more on using the natural properties of plasma to produce advancements. Due to the highly charged and extremely conductive fundamental properties of plasmas, Keidar produced work that harnessed these properties to propel spacecraft through the repulsive properties of the electromagnetic field..

The shift toward more plasma-centered research was furthered by two postdoc appointments at UC Berkeley and Cornell research labs. Now, after almost a decade of research under his belt and a transition toward plasma research, Keidar has amassed unparalleled expertise in the field. Yet, his desire to make advancements in applying these technologies never went away. Pursuing a Professorship at GW, Keidar simultaneously opened a research lab that married his interests in plasma research and aerospace propulsion. The Micropropulsion and Nanoparticles Lab helped focus his interests on extremely small spacecraft and plasma-based nanoparticles. Despite this, Keidar could not expect where his career would turn from here… Cold Plasmas: A Paradigm Shift Almost accidentally, Professor Keidar entered the Biomedical field in a momentous fashion. At the time, in the late 2010s, there was no Department of Biomedical Engineering at GW, yet there was a Biomedical Institute that funded several projects in other departments for biomedical research. Despite being housed in the Mechanical Engineering Department, Keidar sought projects that had biomedical applications for his plasma research. Here, he envisioned working with his “cold” plasmas. “We started to develop what we call cold plasmas. Typical plasma in a lab is millions of degrees Celsius; the trick here is to apply a very strong electromagnetic field, which creates positive ions extremely quickly, allowing for an energetic, room temperature plasma.”  The resulting cold plasma is a cocktail of reactive species, oxygen, nitrogen, and ozone compounds, all present in both the human body and the atmosphere. The creation of these charged species acts as a reservoir that can be called, if necessary, to correct some biological processes. In short, with a cold plasma induced in a cell, these necessary compounds can be delivered without harming the cell. The possibility to induce the creation of these species then affected the pattern of cell migration. “We alter the migration of cells and thought, maybe this would be good to slow down the migration of cells from tumor areas.” Through experiments at Johns Hopkins University, plasma therapy was found to selectively kill cancerous cells. This discovery led to the FDA approval of Canady Helios Cold Plasma to develop plasma therapy into a commercially viable product.  To this day, his plasma medicine research is still his most cited paper, although this remains outside of his “Foundational Work”. Despite this, the dots still connect, as all of this was possible from his understanding of Plasma Fundamentals.  The Marriage of Propulsion and Therapy After his stint focusing on biomedical applications, Keidar returned to the questions that had begun his career: Can we fly satellites low enough in orbit that the air they collect can be converted to plasma and used to cancel out the drag produced by the spacecraft? Typically, with plasma-induced propulsion, ions are expelled and induce a “jet effect”. Issues arise when the positive ions are ejected, as they take the positive charge and leave the satellite negatively charged. On large scales, such as a satellite, this induces such a large negative electrical differential that the positively charged particles are attracted back to the spacecraft, inhibiting the electromagnetic force.  In order to answer this question, Keidar had to look back on his fundamental understanding of plasma physics and atmospheric chemical interactions. Put simply, how can oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere help to solve this problem? One effect of oxygen at low energy is that electrons actually attach to oxygen atoms more strongly than the positively charged ions from the spacecraft. Thus, an expulsion of oxygen could potentially counterbalance the ionic buildup of negative charges.  To test this hypothesis, Keidar needed to call on his previous biomedical work, which involved understanding the same interactions but on a cellular level. When developing the cold plasma cancer therapy research, the interactions between all the induced chemical species from the plasma needed to be monitored to determine the side effects of the treatment. Now, with this database of chemical interactions, it was possible for Keidar to predict the outcomes of his plasma’s effects more precisely. These same species are the ones that interact in the Atmosphere.  Once again, Keidar proves how the dots continue to connect long after the dots begin to appear. Push the Needle Forward: Dr. Keidar’s Wisdom for Aspiring Scientists When asked to reflect on his career and any advice he’d give to aspiring scientists, Keidar focused on watering those curious questions that every scientist needs to have in order to succeed. “It’s hard to develop your direction when you chase the inconsistent interests of others, but you must resist that urge.” Now, at this stage in his career, as a Professor in the capital of the United States, he often finds the interests of others clouding his line of sight. NIH, NSF, DOE, DARPA, DOD, all government agencies that Michael Keidar has worked with to help advance the questions he chooses to attack. Although these groups are important in setting a trend in research, Keidar emphasizes the even greater importance of pursuing meaningful research that is both novel and applicable to real problems faced in these fields “Above all I recommend that people do not chase. Push the needle toward what you believe in” For aspiring scientists, becoming an “expert” in a field is an honor and a dream. To be able to help push forward your tiny corner of STEM is the goal of all professional scientists. At every stage of his career, Dr Keidar pursued what he believed was going to advance the lives of others.  His career has touched fields from brain tumors to satellite development. It begins to show the ever-growing collaborative nature of science, as not distinct disciplines but an orchestra of moving parts. To be able to say you push forward multiple fields, now this is the mark of a very special scientist. The more we study extraordinary people, the more we learn about the importance of connecting the dots. For Jobs, this was merging calligraphy into the design of his first Macintosh Computer. For Professor Michael Keidar, it is exploring the secrets of the fourth state of matter in the universe: plasma. My Own Reflections & Takeaways To me- an aspiring scientist with the expectations of a scientific career placed before me- I was moved by Professor Keidar’s story of creativity and curiosity across the numerous areas of research he has entered. I believe that in the face of an ever increasingly dynamic world, it is important to build skills that can transcend the static barriers of strict categories and instead pursue fundamental interests that can open the doors in even more ways.  For each of us, it is important to take a deep breath and follow our interests, constantly pushing to understand not just the surface, but the underlying mechanisms. Through understanding the core of any field, we can each unlock abilities to further our understanding of the applications of fundamental sciences and their impact on our society. I began with the Steve Jobs quote, legendarily spoken at the Stanford Commencement in 2005, and I believe the end of that quote helps to encapsulate this story as well:  “Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path.” To all the students currently trying to figure out what field they want to enter, what PhD program to enter, what research lab they want to join, or even what classes they want to take next semester, remember to follow your interests and think of the bigger picture. Nurture your curiosity and water your creativity, and remember that when in doubt, have faith that your dots will connect, even when you can’t see how."",""decorations"":[]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""}],""documentStyle"":{}}",,"en",2025-01-28T05:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""pak185171"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""DIVIDER"",""id"":""a4srb5148"",""nodes"":[],""dividerData"":{""containerData"":{""textWrap"":false,""height"":{},""spoiler"":{},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""width"":{}},""lineStyle"":""DOUBLE"",""width"":""LARGE"",""alignment"":""CENTER""}},{""type"":""BLOCKQUOTE"",""id"":""49zux5150"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""kgcqh5246"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""“You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.

While new therapies offer hope, the hunt for a targeted cure remains a formidable challenge. Leading expert Dr. Henry Kaminski guides us through the latest breakthroughs in treatment, the hurdles of drug development, and the innovative, cross-disciplinary collaborations that may finally unlock personalized care for those living with this complex condition. In recent human history, breakthroughs in medicinal research have flourished at a rapid rate, putting an end to many deadly diseases that plagued our world in the past, from smallpox and polio to COVID-19. However, much is still unknown about the development and treatment of autoimmune  diseases, due to their low prevalence and requirement for highly specialized care. Despite its rarity myasthenia gravis (MG), or “grave muscle”, is among the most well-studied muscular autoimmune disorders currently documented[A]. Henry Kaminski, a leading expert on MG, is a professor of neurology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences.  “Back when I was an undergraduate, I wanted to be a scientist. I was a complete failure on my projects, but despite that I still wanted to do this. After graduating residency, I decided to work with this MD/PhD Neurologist, who made the mistake of giving me a project to write a review article on Myasthenia Gravis. From there [it was fascinating to me], and the rest is history—it continues to be more fascinating as we grow, and now with the collaborations and capabilities I have, [there’s always more we can do].” An Attack on the Neuromuscular Junction Autoimmune diseases are characterized by unintended antibody production and activity—targeting and deactivating self-produced, necessary  proteins [ B ]. In the case of MG the antibody types, and therefore ,   targeted proteins  can vary; the overarching determinant of this disease stems from antibodies targeting proteins on the neuromuscular junction  (NMJ) within skeletal muscles [ F ]. This junction is important to facilitate the communication between the brain and the muscles—dysfunction of these junctions can give rise to many symptoms associated with MG, ranging from limited muscle strength and involvement to much more serious problems, such as respiratory failure. As general, nonspecific immunosuppression treatment has long been outdated and associated with increased risk for disease [ G ], the search for efficient targeted treatment of MG is an ongoing challenge.  “We know what produces it, but there were no treatments beyond things that we took from more common diseases to suppress the immune system.”  Current Strategies: A Double-Edged Sword Because the mechanisms of MG are pretty well known, new therapies are made to target particular pressure points of the disease. Kaminski highlights a few leading strategies that have been subject to ongoing research: FcRn inhibitors  are now commonplace in autoimmune treatment. Under normal circumstances, our bodies have the ability to recycle antibodies in the blood, protecting them from degradation [ H ]. This process occurs through neonatal Fc receptors —cell surface proteins that antibodies bind to in order to be internalized and processed, before being released back into the bloodstream. Specially developed inhibitors block  this process by acting as a competitive inhibitor of the Fc receptor , as a way to ensure malignant antibodies are no longer in circulation. Another strategy, complement inhibition , involves not the targeting of the antibody itself, but the pathway  of activation for MG. Rogue antibodies activate a series of enzymatic reactions known as the complement   system , the end result forming a protein complex that breaks down important cells within the NMJ [ K ]. Ultimately, this leads to the destruction of acetyl choline receptors in the muscle, hindering neuromuscular communication [ I ]. Complement inhibitors seek to stop this process and inhibit the pathway by targeting specific, necessary proteins for its continuation. James F. Howard Jr. Myasthenia gravis: the role of complement at the neuromuscular junction. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences . 2017 However, at the base level, these treatments are nonspecific, an issue Kaminski has attempted to solve in the past. A potential solution involves adding a protein  linked to the complement inhibitor drug that targets the neuromuscular junction , which could improve specificity; Kaminski laments on how this project was stopped in its tracks:  “We couldn’t take the next step to optimize this drug. We got a patent to develop this further, but were not able to make this transition. The key in drug development is moving from an established proof of concept to actually ramp up to the drug.”  “[FcRn and Complement inhibitors] don’t cure it, but they’re good to have. Now, we also understand other aspects of the immune system—we can try to wipe out the cells that are producing antibodies. Right now we don’t have a targeted way to eliminate the ‘bad cells’ that produce these antibodies.” The Next Frontier: Specificity and Personalized Models An important next step  in MG drug development research that Kamiski is working towards involves improving technology that is specific for the cells producing the malignant antibodies . While a clear solution proves to elude scientists, the overarching challenges are evident— specificity  is incredibly important, and may be the key doctors need for future treatment—both in the context of targeted therapies, and the development of personalized  patient care plans to combat the high complexity of MG. Rapidly growing and improving in not just current clinical research, but all scientific fields, is the utilization of mathematical models to capture data for predicted outcomes of complex problems. This method for developing a specialized treatment course has already proven to be successful in the context of host-tumor interactions for cancer treatment, which reveal  how an individual’s immune system reacts to not just the growth of cancerous cells, but continued treatment and immunotherapy [ J ]. Kaminski believes, working among peers and mathematicians, that these models are the future of more personalized and targeted treatment for MG patients; newer methods such as these have the capability to shed the limitations of previous strategies for combatting MG. “It offers the opportunity to easily standardize and translate clinical trials. It’s very exciting to have these cross-disciplinary collaborations, and to be able to model these trials to determine patient response to treatment.” Though challenges in drug development and the elusive goal of eliminating specific antibody-producing cells persist, the combination of deepening mechanistic knowledge and sophisticated predictive tools, spearheaded by Dr. Kaminski, positions the field on the cusp of breakthroughs that could fundamentally change outcomes for patients living with this condition.",,0,"en",2025-08-18T04:00:00Z,false,"{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""02nwj495"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune disorder targeting the junction between nerve and muscle, has long been managed with treatments borrowed from more common diseases.

The normal function of the neuromuscular junction, with major components implicated in MG, is shown. The action potential at the presynaptic nerve terminal causes opening of voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels, triggering the release of acetylcholine and agrin into the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine binds to AChRs, which promote sodium channel opening, which triggers muscle contraction. Agrin binds to the complex formed by LRP4 and MuSK, causing AChR clustering; this is required for maintenance of the postsynaptic structures of the neuromuscular junction.
